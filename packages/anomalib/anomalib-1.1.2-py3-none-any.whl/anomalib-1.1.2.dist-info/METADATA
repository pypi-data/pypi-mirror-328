              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

# 👋 Introduction

Anomalib is a deep learning library that aims to collect state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms for benchmarking on both public and private datasets. Anomalib provides several ready-to-use implementations of anomaly detection algorithms described in the recent literature, as well as a set of tools that facilitate the development and implementation of custom models. The library has a strong focus on visual anomaly detection, where the goal of the algorithm is to detect and/or localize anomalies within images or videos in a dataset. Anomalib is constantly updated with new algorithms and training/inference extensions, so keep checking!

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib/main/docs/source/_static/images/readme.png" width="1000" alt="A prediction made by anomalib">
</p>

## Key features

- Simple and modular API and CLI for training, inference, benchmarking, and hyperparameter optimization.
- The largest public collection of ready-to-use deep learning anomaly detection algorithms and benchmark datasets.
- [**Lightning**](https://www.lightning.ai/) based model implementations to reduce boilerplate code and limit the implementation efforts to the bare essentials.
- The majority of models can be exported to [**OpenVINO**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/openvino-toolkit/overview.html) Intermediate Representation (IR) for accelerated inference on Intel hardware.
- A set of [inference tools](tools) for quick and easy deployment of the standard or custom anomaly detection models.

# 📦 Installation

Anomalib provides two ways to install the library. The first is through PyPI, and the second is through a local installation. PyPI installation is recommended if you want to use the library without making any changes to the source code. If you want to make changes to the library, then a local installation is recommended.

<details>
<summary>Install from PyPI</summary>
Installing the library with pip is the easiest way to get started with anomalib.

```bash
pip install anomalib
```

This will install Anomalib CLI using the [dependencies](/pyproject.toml) in the `pyproject.toml` file. Anomalib CLI is a command line interface for training, inference, benchmarking, and hyperparameter optimization. If you want to use the library as a Python package, you can install the library with the following command:

```bash
# Get help for the installation arguments
anomalib install -h

# Install the full package
anomalib install

# Install with verbose output
anomalib install -v

# Install the core package option only to train and evaluate models via Torch and Lightning
anomalib install --option core

# Install with OpenVINO option only. This is useful for edge deployment as the wheel size is smaller.
anomalib install --option openvino
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Install from source</summary>
To install from source, you need to clone the repository and install the library using pip via editable mode.

```bash
# Use of virtual environment is highly recommended
# Using conda
yes | conda create -n anomalib_env python=3.10
conda activate anomalib_env

# Or using your favorite virtual environment
# ...

# Clone the repository and install in editable mode
git clone https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib.git
cd anomalib
pip install -e .
```

This will install Anomalib CLI using the [dependencies](/pyproject.toml) in the `pyproject.toml` file. Anomalib CLI is a command line interface for training, inference, benchmarking, and hyperparameter optimization. If you want to use the library as a Python package, you can install the library with the following command:

```bash
# Get help for the installation arguments
anomalib install -h

# Install the full package
anomalib install

# Install with verbose output
anomalib install -v

# Install the core package option only to train and evaluate models via Torch and Lightning
anomalib install --option core

# Install with OpenVINO option only. This is useful for edge deployment as the wheel size is smaller.
anomalib install --option openvino
```

</details>

# 🧠 Training

Anomalib supports both API and CLI-based training. The API is more flexible and allows for more customization, while the CLI training utilizes command line interfaces, and might be easier for those who would like to use anomalib off-the-shelf.

<details>
<summary>Training via API</summary>

```python
# Import the required modules
from anomalib.data import MVTec
from anomalib.models import Patchcore
from anomalib.engine import Engine

# Initialize the datamodule, model and engine
datamodule = MVTec()
model = Patchcore()
engine = Engine()

# Train the model
engine.fit(datamodule=datamodule, model=model)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Training via CLI</summary>

```bash
# Get help about the training arguments, run:
anomalib train -h

# Train by using the default values.
anomalib train --model Patchcore --data anomalib.data.MVTec

# Train by overriding arguments.
anomalib train --model Patchcore --data anomalib.data.MVTec --data.category transistor

# Train by using a config file.
anomalib train --config <path/to/config>
```

</details>

# 🤖 Inference

Anomalib includes multiple inferencing scripts, including Torch, Lightning, Gradio, and OpenVINO inferencers to perform inference using the trained/exported model. Here we show an inference example using the Lightning inferencer. For other inferencers, please refer to the [Inference Documentation](https://anomalib.readthedocs.io).

<details>
<summary>Inference via API</summary>

The following example demonstrates how to perform Lightning inference by loading a model from a checkpoint file.

```python
# Assuming the datamodule, model and engine is initialized from the previous step,
# a prediction via a checkpoint file can be performed as follows:
predictions = engine.predict(
    datamodule=datamodule,
    model=model,
    ckpt_path="path/to/checkpoint.ckpt",
)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Inference via CLI</summary>

```bash
# To get help about the arguments, run:
anomalib predict -h

# ⚙️ Hyperparameter Optimization

Anomalib supports hyperparameter optimization (HPO) using [wandb](https://wandb.ai/) and [comet.ml](https://www.comet.com/). For more details refer the [HPO Documentation](https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/anomalib/tutorials/hyperparameter_optimization.html)

<details>
<summary>HPO via API</summary>

```python
# To be enabled in v1.1
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>HPO via CLI</summary>

The following example demonstrates how to perform HPO for the Patchcore model.

```bash
anomalib hpo --backend WANDB  --sweep_config tools/hpo/configs/wandb.yaml
```

# 🧪 Experiment Management

Anomalib is integrated with various libraries for experiment tracking such as Comet, tensorboard, and wandb through [pytorch lighting loggers](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extensions/logging.html). For more information, refer to the [Logging Documentation](https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/anomalib/tutorials/logging.html)

<details>
<summary>Experiment Management via API</summary>

```python
# To be enabled in v1.1
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Experiment Management via CLI</summary>

Below is an example of how to enable logging for hyper-parameters, metrics, model graphs, and predictions on images in the test data-set.

You first need to modify the `config.yaml` file to enable logging. The following example shows how to enable logging:

```yaml
# Place the experiment management config here.
```

```bash
# Place the Experiment Management CLI command here.
```

# 📊 Benchmarking

Anomalib provides a benchmarking tool to evaluate the performance of the anomaly detection models on a given dataset. The benchmarking tool can be used to evaluate the performance of the models on a given dataset, or to compare the performance of multiple models on a given dataset.

Each model in anomalib is benchmarked on a set of datasets, and the results are available in `src/anomalib/models/<type>/<model_name>/README.md`. For example, the MVTec AD results for the Patchcore model are available in the corresponding [README.md](src/anomalib/models/image/patchcore/README.md#mvtec-ad-dataset) file.

<details>
<summary>Benchmarking via API</summary>

```python
# To be enabled in v1.1
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Benchmarking via CLI</summary>

To run the benchmarking tool, run the following command:

```bash
anomalib benchmark --config tools/benchmarking/benchmark_params.yaml
```
