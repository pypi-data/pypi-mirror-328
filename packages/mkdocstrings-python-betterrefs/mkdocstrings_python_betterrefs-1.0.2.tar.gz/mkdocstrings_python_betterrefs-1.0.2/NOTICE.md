This project forks off of the original project:
[mkdocstrings-python-xref](https://github.com/analog-garage/mkdocstrings-python-xref). This project was created by
Christopher Barber and copyrighted by Analog Devices, Inc. (2022-2023)

The original project was licensed under the Apache 2.0 License, which this fork also uses. According to the terms of
the Apache 2.0 License, significant modifications made to the project are required to be listed here. Below are the key
changes introduced in this fork:

- **Documentation:** The documentation has been extensively modified and relicensed under a Creative Commons license
  (see the `LICENSE.txt` file in the `docs/` directory for more information). The usage page retains some original
  content but has been reorganized for better readability.
- **User Experience:** This fork aims to make migration from the original project as seamless as possible. While the
  user interface remains largely the same, the handler has been renamed from mkdocstrings-python-xref to
  mkdocstrings-python-betterrefs, some config options were also renamed.
- **Source Code:** Various changes have been made to the source code, with more ongoing. For a detailed list of changes,
  please refer to the project's `CHANGELOG.md` file.

The reason for this fork was mainly personal curiosity and the desire to heavily modify the packaging practices and the
code base, but also to address some issues which the original maintainer took a while to get to. This project is
essentially a direct continuation of the original project, bringing it up-to-date with latest mkdocs-python.
