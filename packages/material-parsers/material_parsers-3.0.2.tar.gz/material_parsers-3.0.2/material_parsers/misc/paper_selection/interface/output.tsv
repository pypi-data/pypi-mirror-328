PR06015055-CC.pdf	PR06015055-CC.pdf	The Hall effect in Zn-doped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ revisited: Hall angle and the pseudogap 	The temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient is measured with a high accuracy in a series of YBa2(Cu1−zZnz)3O6.78 crystals with 0≤z≤0.013. We found that the cotangent of the Hall angle, cot θH , starts to deviate upwardly from the T 2 dependence below T0 (∼130 K), regardless of the Zn concentration. We discuss that this deviation is caused by the pseudogap; the direction of the deviation and its insensitivity to the Zn doping suggest that the pseudogap affects cot θH through a change in the effective mass, rather than through a change in the Hall scattering rate. 		2.27777777777778	95.9512195121951

The zz scattering polarization has been investigated at room temperature, where two strong modes due to La/Sr and the apex oxygen atoms are observed. The energy of the strong modes increases almost linearly with pressure for the Sr concentrations studied. Modifications in the increment rate dω/dp have been detected depending on the amount of doping. Finally, measurements at low temperatures denote that the application of pressure minimizes the distortions of the CuO 6 octahedra. 		3.70588235294118	35.8095238095238

The a-and c-parameters were contracted with increase in the oxygen deficiency. When the a-parameter is reduced to 3.964 Å from that of non- superconducting sample, the superconductivity is induced with an abrupt raise of T c and the T c saturates about 53 K at a=3.94 ~ 3.95 Å. 		3.47058823529412	34.864406779661

A third peak in the normal conduc- tivity, σ1(T ), at around 80K, and enhanced pair conductivity σ2(T ) below ∼ 65K are observed. The data are inconsistent with a single order parameter, and instead are indicative of multi-component superconductivity. Overall, these results point to the presence of multiple pairing interactions in Y Ba2Cu3O6.95 and also provide a natural explanation to account for the low temperature 35K conductivity peak observed in all Y Ba2Cu3O6.95 crystals. 		3.72727272727273	40.9512195121951
PR05703245-CC.pdf	PR05703245-CC.pdf		Tunneling conductance of normal metal / d x 2 −y 2 -wave superconductor junctions in the presence of broken time reversal symmetry states near interfaces In order to clarify the influence of (the presence of) the broken time-reversal symmetry state (BTRSS) induced near the interface, tunneling conductance spectra in normal metal / d x 2 −y 2 -wave superconductor junctions are calcu- lated on the basis of the quasiclassical Green's function method. The spatial dependence of the pair potential in the superconductor side is determined self-consistently. We discuss two types of the symmetry on the BTRSS; i) d x 2 −y 2 +is-wave state and ii) d x 2 −y 2 +id xy -wave state. It is shown that the am- plitude of the subdominant component (is-wave or id xy -wave) is quite sensitive to the transmission coefficient of the junction. As the results, the splitting of the zero-bias conductance peak due to the BTRSS inducement is detectable only at junctions with small transmission coefficients for both cases. When the transmission coefficients are relatively large, the explicit peak splitting does not occur and the difference in the two cases appears in the height of the zero-bias peaks. 		0.189189189189189	1172.71428571429

We find that the variation of Tc scales as a function of ρc, and that the c-axis pressure coefficient is much stronger than the ab-axis one. These imply that Tc depends primarily on the interlayer, rather than the in-plane, lattice parameter. 		6.61904761904762	28.0143884892086
PR05814581-CC.pdf	PR05814581-CC.pdf	Anisotropic renormalized fluctuations in the microwave resistivity in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ 	We discuss the excess conductivity above Tc due to renormalized order-parameter fluctuations in YBa2Cu3O 7−δ (YBCO) at microwave frequencies. We calculate the effects of the uniaxial anisotropy on the renormalized fluctuations in the Hartree approximation, extending the isotropic theory de- veloped by Dorsey [Phys. Rev. B 43, 7575 (1991)]. Measurements of the real part of the microwave resistivity at 24 and 48 GHz and of the dc resistivity are performed on different YBCO films. The onset of the superconducting transition and the deviation from the linear temperature behavior above Tc can be fully accounted for by the extended theory. According to the theoretical calculation here presented, a departure from gaussian toward renormalized fluctuations is observed. Very con- sistent values of the fundamental parameters (critical temperature, coherence lenghts, penetration depth) of the superconducting state are obtained. 		4.63157894736842	65.8977272727273

Both T c and superfluid density n s ,  λ -2 , decrease with overdoping. They obey the scaling relation T c  [λ -2 (0)] α with α  ½. We discuss this result in the frameworks of disordered d-wave superconductors and of scaling near quantum critical points. Our result, and the linear scaling (α  1) found for the more anisotropic T 2 Ba 2 CuO 6+δ , can both be understood in terms of quantum critical scaling, with different dimensionalities for fluctuations. 		2.67741935483871	37.3012048192771

Substitution of Cu with Zn in the CuO2 planes is found to induce carrier localization at low temperatures in ""clean"" samples with kF l > 5, where the mean free path l is larger than the electron wave length and thus localization is not normally expected. The destruction of the local antiferromagnetic correlation among Cu spins by Zn is discussed to be the possible origin of this unusual charge localization. "		3.23529411764706	70.9636363636364

From the scaling analysis of the magnetization data the pressure induced shifts of the transition temperature Tc, the volume V and the anisotropy γ have been ob- tained. It was shown that the pressure induced relative shift of Tc mirrors essentially that of the anisotropy.

PR0446999-CC.pdf	PR0446999-CC.pdf		We have studied both single and polycrystalline samples of Eu 1−x K x Fe 2 As 2 with x= 0, 0.35, 0.45 and 0.5 by means of electrical resistivity, susceptibility as well as specific heat measurements. Above 40 K, the susceptibility of single crystalline EuFe 2 As 2 , measured in fields applied along and perpendicular to the c-axis, is isotropic. In addition to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin density wave (SDW) transition at 190 K associated with the FeAs layers, the compound undergoes another magnetic phase transition at 19 K due to AFM ordering of Eu 2+ moments. For x = 0.5, a well defined anomaly in the specific heat related to the superconducting (SC) transition at T c = 32 K confirms bulk superconductivity in this compound. The relative height of the specific-heat jump is larger than the BCS value indicating strong-coupling effects. 		8.81818181818182	21.5463917525773

It was also shown that superconductivity reported by Zou et al. [Phys. Rev.

The DC-magnetisation data establish that this material exhibits ferromagnetic order of the Ru-moments (µ(Ru) ≈ 1 µB) below TCurie = 133 K and becomes su- perconducting at a much lower temperature Tc = 16 K. The ZF-µSR experiments indicate that the ferromagnetic phase is homogeneous on a microscopic scale and accounts for most of the sample volume. They also suggest that the magnetic order is not significantly modified at the onset of superconductivity. 		5.93548387096774	43.8532608695652

The frequency dependent con- ductivity has a maximum near 500 cm −1 at room temperature, which shifts to lower frequency and merges with a Drude peak below 100 K. We attribute the unusual behavior of the mid-infrared conductivity to low frequency tran- sitions between electronic bands of mainly BiO character near the M point.

PR05511832-CC.pdf	PR05511832-CC.pdf		Using a mean-field BCS-like approach on the bidimensional extended Hubbard Hamiltonian we calculate the superconducting transition temperature T c as a func- tion of the hole content n h . This method can be used to determine the critical temperatures T c either for the extended − s wave or d wave symmetry. We can also describe the pressure effects on T c by introducing the assumption that it induces a change in the magnitude V of the attractive potential. This assumption yields an explanation for the intrinsic term, and together with the well known change in n h , we set the critical temperature as T c = T c (n h (P ), V (P ). Then, we obtain a general expansion of T c in terms of the pressure P and the hole content n h . We apply this expansion to the T l 0.5 P b 0.5 Sr 2 Ca 1−x Y x Cu 2 O 7 system (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.35) and our results provide a good fitting for the experimental data for the variation of T c with the pressure P and n h . 		2.1	61.6984126984127

The reflectivity of La1.87Sr0.13CuO4 has been measured in the frequency range 30 -9,000 cm −1 (0.004 -1 eV) both parallel and perpendicular to the CuO2 planes, whereas La1.86Sr0.14CuO4 was studied only in the ab-plane. The extended Drude model shows that the frequency-dependent effective scattering rate 1/τ (ω, T ) is strongly suppressed below the high-frequency straight-line ex- trapolation, a signature of the pseudogap state. This suppression can be seen from temperatures below the superconducting transition up to 400 K. In the case of underdoped LSCO the straight-line extrapolation is temperature independent below 200 K, whereas above 200 K there is a strong tem- perature dependence of the high-frequency 1/τ (ω, T ). The out-of-plane direction is also examined for evidence of the pseudogap state. 		3	36.0625
PR06114350-CC.pdf	PR06114350-CC.pdf	Impurity scattering effects on the low-temperature specific heat of d-wave superconductors 	Very recently impurity scattering effects on quasiparticles in d-wave superconductors have attracted much attention. Especially, the thermodynamic properties in magnetic fields H are of interest. We have measured the low-temperature specific heat C(T,H) of La 1.78 Sr 0.22 Cu 1-x Ni x O 4 . For the first time, the impurity scattering effects on C(T,H) of cuprate superconductors were clearly observed, and are compared with theory of d-wave superconductivity. It is found that impurity scattering leads to g(H)=g(0)(1+D´(H/H c2 )´ln(H c2 /H) in small magnetic fields. Most amazingly, the scaling of C(T,H) breaks down due to impurity scattering. 		3.73333333333333	60.8035714285714

For transport perpendicular to the CuO chains, κa(300K) ≃ 10W/mK, and along the chains, κ b (300K) ≃ 40W/mK. The temperature dependence of κ for both transport directions is much stronger than in YBa2Cu3O6+x (Y-123), indicative of substantially superior lattice heat conduction in Y-124, and resulting in maximum values for κ at T ∼ 20K exceeding 200W/mK. The data imply a surprisingly large anisotropy in the lattice conduction. κa and κ b are enhanced in the superconducting state as in other cuprates. The magnitude and anisotropy of the enhancement are discussed and compared to those of Y-123. 		5.47368421052632	37.4519230769231
PR05909642-CC.pdf	PR05909642-CC.pdf	Doping Dependence of the Pseudogap in La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 	We report the results of Raman scattering experiments on single crystals of La2−xSrxCuO4 that span the range from underdoped (x = 0.10) to overdoped (x =0.22). The spectra are consistent with the existence of a strong anisotropic quasiparticle interaction that results in a normal state depletion of spectral weight from regions of the Fermi surface located near the zone axes. The strength of the interaction decreases rapidly with increasing hole concentration and the spectral evidence for the pseudogap vanishes when the optimum doping level is reached. The results suggest that the pseudogap and superconducting gap arise from different mechanisms. 		2.55882352941176	61.6206896551724

It is found that the ""universal"" relation between the room-temperature thermopower and Tc does not hold in the BSLCO system. Instead, comparison of the temperature- dependent RH data with other cuprate systems is used as a tool to identify the actual p value. To justify this approach, we compare normalized RH(T ) data of BSLCO, La2−xSrxCuO4 (LSCO), YBa2Cu3Oy, and Tl2Ba2CuO 6+δ , and demonstrate that the RH(T ) data of the LSCO system can be used as a template for the estimation of p.

A distinct change in the behaviour of λc is observed near 0.20 holes/Cu, which is related to the opening of the normal state pseudogap. The variation of λc with doping is qualitatively similar to that of the in-plane component, λ ab , which suggests that the c-axis superfluid response is mainly governed by the superconducting condensation energy. The strong doping dependence of λc(0) for p < 0.20 provides an explanation for the discrepancies in the literature. 		4.85714285714286	42.3529411764706

Also, λ −2 (T ) at low T is exponential at optimal and overdoping but is quadratic at underdoping. In light of other studies that suggest both d -and s-wave pairing symmetry in nominally optimally doped samples, our results are evidence for a transition from d -to s-wave pairing near optimal doping. 		4.22222222222222	37.6184210526316

Transverse field measurements (H=0.007 T) show line broaden- ing below Tc, which is characteristic of a vortex state, demonstrating conclusively the type-II nature of this superconductor. The penetration depth is seen to level off below about 400 mK (T /Tc ∼ 0.4), with a rather large value of λ(T = 0) ∼ 7500Å. The temperature independent behavior below ∼ 400 mK is consistent with a nodeless superconducting energy gap. Zero-field measurements indicate no static magnetic fields developing below the transition temperature. 		3.05555555555556	54.1636363636364

We studied whether spin fluctuations are involved in increasing Tc under a pressure of 3.0 GPa by using the 75 As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique. The 75 As-NMR results for the powder samples show that Tc increases up to 48 K with- out the influence of spin fluctuations. This fact indicates that spin fluctuations are not involved in raising Tc, which implies that other factors, such as orbital degrees of freedom, may be important for achieving a high Tc of almost 50 K. 		11.4375	19.9453551912568

The paramagnetic shifts of both planar and apical oxygen sites show pronounced anomalies near the nominal a-axis strain ε aa ≡ ε v that maximizes the superconducting transition temperature T c . The spin susceptibility weakly increases on lowering the temperature below T ≃ 10 K, consistent with an enhanced density of states associated with passing the Fermi energy through a van Hove singularity. Although such a Lifshitz transition occurs in the γ band formed by the Ru d xy states hybridized with in-plane O p π orbitals, the large Hund's coupling renormalizes the uniform spin susceptibility, which, in turn, affects the hyperfine fields of all nuclei.

The substrate temperature dependence of orientation and superconducting poperties were systematically studied. Good quality c and a-axis orientated films can be obtained on SrTiO 3 via changing the substrate temperature solely. On YSZ, films with good c-axis orientation can be grown, while it is hard to grow films with good a-axis orientation by changing substrate temperature alone. The highest T C0 is about 37K, which is found in the films grown on YSZ with a good c-axis orientation. For the films grown on STO, however, the highest T C0 is about 35.6K with a mixed orientation of c-axis and a-axis. In most of the superconducting films, the weak temperature dependence of the normal state resistivity, as characterized by small R(290K)/R(50K) ≤ 2 ratios, together with a weak localization behavior just above T C could be attributed to the essential scattering due to the localized electronic states. The superconducting transitions in a field up to 10 T along c-axis have been measured on a c-axis oriented film grown on SrTiO 3 . The zero-temperature in-plane upper critical field B ab C2 (0) is estimated from the resistivity transition data. 		4.85714285714286	41.5294117647059

Beyond this critical point, the normal state is a Fermi liquid characterized by the T1T =const relation. A comparison of the superconducting state with the H-induced normal state in the x=0.40 (Tc = 32 K) sample indicates that there remains substantial part of the Fermi surface even in the fully-developed PG state, which suggests that the PG and SC are coexisting matters. 		6.11764705882353	33.3076923076923

T he strong magnetoresistivity, which persists even at temperatures far above T c , can be related to the pairs forming eventually the superconducting state below T c .

We report that superconductivity in the infinite-layer compound Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 is of a three-dimensional nature, in contrast to the quasi two-dimensional superconducting behavior of all other cuprates. The key observation is that the c-axis coherence length is longer than the c-axis lattice constant even at zero temperature. This means that the superconducting order parameter of one CuO2 plane overlaps with those of neighboring CuO2 planes all the temperatures below the Tc. Among all cuprates, only the infinite- layer superconductor shows such a feature. 		4.52941176470588	46.6233766233766

L095167004-CC.pdf	L095167004-CC.pdf	High pressure effects on the superconductivity of β-pyrochlore oxides AOs 2 O 6 	High pressure effects on the superconducting transitions of β-pyrochlore oxide superconductors AOs 2 O 6 (A = Cs, Rb, K) are studied by measuring resistivity under high pressures up to 10 GPa. The superconducting transition temperature T c first increases with increasing pressure in all the compounds and then exhibits a broad maximum at 7.6 K (6 GPa), 8.2 K (2 GPa) and 10 K (0.6 GPa) for A = Cs, Rb and K, respectively. Finally, the superconductivity is suppressed completely at a critical pressure near 7 GPa and 6 GPa for A = Rb and K and probably above 10 GPa for A = Cs. Characteristic changes in the coefficient A of the T 2 term in resistivity and residual resistivity are observed, both of which are synchronized with the corresponding change in T c . It is suggested that electron correlations and certain quantum fluctuations play important roles in the occurrence or suppression of superconductivity in the β-pyrochlore oxides. 1 A new family of transition metal oxide superconductors AOs 2 O 6 (A = Cs, Rb, K) called β-pyrochlore oxides was found recently [1-4]. They exhibit superconductivity at T c = 3.3 K, 6.3 K and 9.6 K, respectively. Extensive studies are now in progress in order to elucidate the mechanism of the superconductivity. Very recent µSR [5] and NMR [6] experiments revealed that unconventional superconductivity is realized, particularly in KOs 2 O 6 with the highest T c . In contrast, there are a few reports insisting on conventional BCS-type superconductivity in RbOs 2 O 6 [7, 8]. Concerning the normal-state properties, the temperature dependence of resistivity shows T 2 behavior at low temperature for every compound, implying that electron correlations are sufficiently strong to stabilize a Fermi liquid state. The coefficient A of the T 2 term in resistivity is larger in KOs 2 O 6 than in CsOs 2 O 6 and RbOs 2 O 6 . Moreover, it is found that the Sommerfeld coefficient γ from specific heat measurements is nearly equal for the Cs and Rb compounds, γ = 20 mJ/K 2 molOs [9], while it is much larger for KOs 2 O 6 [10]. Hence there must be a large mass enhancement toward KOs 2 O 6 due to electron correlations. The superconducting transition temperature of the β-pyrochlore oxides increases with decreasing the ionic radius of A-site alkali metals from Cs to K. Accordingly, the lattice volume is decreased by the negative chemical pressure. This fact implies that the reduction of the lattice volume by applying physical pressure would further enhance T c . This expectation was confirmed actually in previous two high-pressure (HP) experiments by measuring magnetization up to 1.2 GPa for all the members [11] and up to 0.8 GPa for RbOs 2 O 6 [7]. Another interesting finding in the former study is that only in the case of KOs 2 O 6 the T c exhibits a saturation around 0.6 GPa and then decreases slightly with pressure, suggesting complicated pressure dependences at higher pressures. Thus, it is important to investigate the pressure dependence of T c and other properties in a wider pressure range. It is also intriguing to search for another ground state which would exist next to the superconducting state under very high pressure, as often found in other unconventional superconductors [12]. In this Letter, we report on resistivity measurements under high pressures up to 10 GPa on all the three members of the β-pyrochlore oxide superconductors. A characteristic pressure-temperature phase diagram has been obtained, where in general the T c exhibits a dome-shaped change as a function of pressure. Polycrystalline samples of AOs 2 O 6 were prepared as reported previously [1-3]. For CsOs 2 O 6 and RbOs 2 O 6 , they were nearly single-phase including a small amount of Os metal. For KOs 2 O 6 , 10 mol% of Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 was contained as another phase, which was necessary to obtain a sufficiently hard pellet for resistivity measurements. The coexistence of Cd 2 Os 2 O 7 may not affect the determination of T c , because it becomes insulating below 230 K [13]. Electrical resistivity measurements were performed by the four-probe method in a cubic-anvil press apparatus [14] at high pressures from 2 GPa to 10 GPa and temperatures from 3 K to 300 K. A fluorinert liquid, which is a one-to-one mixture of FC-70 and FC-77 (3M TM ), was used as a pressure transmitting medium. A polycrystalline pellet of a typical size of 0.8 × 0.3 × 0.4 mm 3 was immersed into the fluorinert liquid in a cylindrical teflon capsule of 1.5 φ × 1.8 mm 3 size. Then, the capsule was put into a cubic pyrophillite block of 6.0 mm edge and compressed almost isostatically by using six anvils made of tungsten carbide. The whole of the sample cell and the press was placed in a liquid-helium dewar to cool down to 3 K. Each run of resistivity 		9.47826086956522	16.9128440366972

Pressure-induced superconductivity in a spin-ladder cuprate Sr2Ca12Cu24O41 has not been studied on a microscopic level so far although the superconductivity was already discovered in 1996. We have improved high-pressure technique with using a large high-quality crystal, and succeeded in studying the superconductivity using 63 Cu nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We found that anomalous metallic state reflecting the spin-ladder structure is realized and the superconductivity possesses a s-wavelike character in the meaning that a finite gap exists in the quasi-particle excitation: At pressure of 3.5GPa we observed two excitation modes in the normal state from the relaxation rate T −1 1 . One gives rise to an activation-type component in T −1 1 , and the other T -linear component linking directly with the superconductivity. This gapless mode likely arises from free motion of holon-spinon bound states appearing by hole doping, and the pairing of them likely causes the superconductivity. 		2.82352941176471	63.6041666666667

EPL0330153-CC.pdf	EPL0330153-CC.pdf	Linear Temperature Variation of the Penetration Depth in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ Thin Films 	We have measured the penetration depth λ(T ) on YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 thin films from transmission at 120, 330 and 510 GHz, between 5 and 50 K. Our data yield simultaneously the absolute value and the temperature dependence of λ(T ). In high quality films λ(T ) exhibits the same linear temperature depen- dence as single crystals, showing its intrinsic nature, and λ(0) = 1750Å. In a lower quality one, the more usual T 2 dependence is found, and λ(0) = 3600Å. This suggests that the T 2 variation is of extrinsic origin. Our results put the d-wave like interpretation in a much better position. 		2.54545454545455	59.7142857142857

India Though the superconducting phase of the type-II Dirac semimetal PdTe2 was shown to be con- ventional in nature, the phase continued to be interesting in terms of its magnetic properties. While certain experiments indicated an unexpected type-I superconducting phase, other experiments re- vealed formation of vortices under the application of magnetic fields. Recently, scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) experiments revealed the existence of a mixed phase where type-I and type-II behaviours coexist. Here, based on our temperature and magnetic field dependent STS experiments on Cu-intercalated PdTe2 we show that as the critical temperature of the superconducting phase goes up from 1.7 K to 2.4 K on Cu-intercalation, the mixed phase disappears and the system be- comes homogeneously type-II. This may be attributed to an averaging effect caused by quasiparticle exchange between type-I and type-II domains mediated by the Cu atoms and to decreased coherence length due to increased disorder. 		5.46153846153846	48.8169014084507

sun2012re-emerging-CC.pdf	sun2012re-emerging-CC.pdf	Reemerging superconductivity at 48 K in iron chalcogenides 	Pressure plays an essential role in the induction 1 and control 2,3 of superconductivity in iron-based superconductors. Substitution of a large cation by a smaller rare-earth ion to simulate the pressure effects has raised the superconducting transition temperature T C to a record high of 55 K in these materials 4,5 . Analogous to the bell-shaped curve of T C dependence on chemical doping, pressure-tuned T C typically drops monotonically after passing the optimal pressure 1-3 . Here we report the observations of an unexpected phenomenon in superconducting iron chalcogenides that after the T C dropped from the maximum of 32 K at 1 GPa and vanished (< 4 K) above 9.5 GPa, a second superconducting region with considerably higher T C than the first maximum suddenly reemerged above 11.5 GPa. The T C of the reemerging superconducting phase reaches 48.0-48.7 K for Tl 0.6 Rb 0.4 Fe 1.67 Se 2 , K 0.8 Fe 1.7 Se 2 and K 0.8 Fe 1.78 Se 2 , setting a new T C record for iron chalcogenide superconductors. The recent discoveries of superconductivity at 30-32 K in a new family of iron-based chalcogenide superconductors 6-9 A 1-x Fe 2-y Se 2 (A=K, Rb or Cs, with possible Tl substitution) bring new excitement to the field of superconductivity 10 . Some of the most striking features of such superconductors include the unusually large magnetic moments up to 3.3  B per Fe atom and the Fe-vacancy ordering in the Fe square lattice 11 . How superconductivity with such a high T C can exist on such a strong magnetic background remains perplexing 10 . It has been established that the superconductivity in strongly correlated electronic systems can be dictated by their crystallographic structure, electronic charge, as well as orbital and spin degree of freedom, which in turn, can be manipulated by controlling parameters including pressure, magnetic field, and chemical composition 12-15 . Pressure is a 'clean' way to tune basic electronic and structural properties without changing the chemistry. High-pressure studies are thus very useful in elucidating mechanisms of superconductivity as well as in searching for new high-T C 		6.3	29.8571428571429

It is found that the shrinking rate of the lattice parameter c for Cu substitution is much smaller than that of Co/Ni substitution. This is in conjugation with the observation of ARPES that shows almost the same electron and hole Fermi surfaces (FSs) size for undoped and Cu substituted LiFeAs sample, except for a very small hole band sinking below Fermi level with doping. This indicates that there is little doping effect at Fermi surface by Cu substitution, in sharp contrast to the more effective carrier doping effect by Ni or Co. 		4.63157894736842	38.7045454545454

According to a previous report from an X-ray diffraction experiment, α changes from 101.5 • at 0 GPa to 97.8 • at 17 GPa.

At ambient pressure, the Cu-substitution is known to suppress the spin density wave (SDW) phase in pure BaFe 2 As 2 (T SDW ≈ 140 K) and to induce a superconducting (SC) dome with a maximum transition temperature T max c 4.2 K. This T max c is much lower than the T c ∼ 15-28 K achieved in the case of Ru, Ni and Co substitutions. Such a lower T c is attributed to a Cu 2+ magnetic pair-breaking effect. The latter is strongly suppressed by applied pressure, as shown herein, T c can be significantly enhanced by applying high pressures. In this work, we investigated the pressure effects on Cu 2+ magnetic pair-breaking in the BaFe 2−x Cu x As 2 series. Around the optimal concentration (x opd = 0.11), all samples showed a substantial increase of T c as a function of pressure. Yet for those samples with a slightly higher doping level (over-doped regime), T c presented a dome-like shape with maximum T c 8 K. Remarkably interesting, the under-doped samples, e.g. x = 0.02 display a maximum pressure induced T c 30 K which is comparable to the maximum T c 's found for the pure compound under external pressures. Furthermore, the magnetoresistance effect as a function of pressure in the normal state of the x = 0.02 sample also presented an evolution consistent with the screening of the Cu 2+ local moments. These findings demonstrate that the Cu 2+ magnetic pair-breaking effect is completely suppressed by applying pressure in the low concentration regime of Cu 2+ substituted BaFe 2 As 2 . 		9.23076923076923	27.475

Two batches of single crystals K x Fe 2 Se 2 with different transition temperatures (T c ) were used to study the effect of pressure. The T c of the first one gradually decreases with increasing pressure from 32.6 K at ambient pressure. While a dome-like behavior was observed for the crystal with T c = 31.1 K, T c reaches its maximum value of 32.7 K at the pressure of 0.48 GPa. This indicates that there exists an optimal doping with maximum T c of 32.7 K in the K x Fe 2 Se 2 system. The behavior of T c versus pressure for Cs x Fe 2 Se 2 also shows a dome-like behavior, and T c reaches its maximum value of 31.1 K at a pressure of 0.82 GPa. The hump observed in the temperature dependence of resistivity for all of the samples tends to shift to high temperature with increasing pressure. The resistivity hump could arise from the vacancy of Fe or Se. 		15.5714285714286	12.954128440367
chu2009high-CC.pdf	chu2009high-CC.pdf	High Pressure Studies on Fe-Pnictide Superconductors 	A review of high-pressure studies on Fe-pnictide superconductors is given. The pressure effects on the magnetic and superconducting transitions are discussed for different classes of doped and undoped FeAs-compounds, ROFeAs (R = rare earth), AeFe 2 As 2 (Ae = Ca, Sr, Ba), and AFeAs (A = Li, Na). Pressure tends to decrease the magnetic transition temperature in the undoped or 2 only slightly doped compounds. The superconducting T c increases with pressure for underdoped FeAs-pnictides, remains approximately constant for optimal doping, and decreases linearly in the overdoped range. The undoped LaOFeAs and AeFe 2 As 2 become superconducting under pressure although nonhydrostatic pressure conditions seem to play a role in CaFe 2 As 2 . The superconductivity in the (undoped) AFeAs is explained as a chemical pressure effect due to the volume contraction caused by the small ionic size of the A-elements. The binary FeSe shows the largest pressure coefficient of T c in the Se-deficient superconducting phase. 		7.9672131147541	20.5905349794239

We found a pressure-induced superconductivity in LaFeAsO. The maximum value of T c is 21 K at ~12 GPa. The pressure dependence of the T c is similar to those of LaFeAsO 1-x F x series reported previously. Recent discovery of Fe-based oxypnictide superconductor LaFeAsO 1-x F x with superconducting transition temperature T c of ~26 K has attracted great interests in the field of condensed matter physics. 1) The crystal structure of LaFeAsO 1-x F x is a tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type structure (P4/nmm), and is composed of a stack of insulating LaO and conducting FeAs layers. It is thought that conductive carriers are confined two dimensionally in the FeAs layers and the carrier concentration can be increased by the substitution of O 2-by F -. The parent compound LaFeAsO is metallic and undergoes a structural phase transition at ~160 K and a magnetic phase transition at ~140 K. 2,3) The crystal structure changes from the tetragonal to orthorhombic, then the compound exhibits a spin density wave type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. The structural distortion and the magnetic ordering are suppressed by the F substitution, resulting in the emergence of the superconductivity. Right after the discovery of the superconductivity in LaFeAsO 1-x F x , it was reported that the T c of LaFeAsO 0.89 F 0.11 shows large pressure effect and increases to a maximum of 43 K at 4 GPa, suggesting that the lattice contraction is effective in the enhancement of the T c of oxypnictide compounds. 4) Actually, RFeAsO (R = rare earth) having smaller R atom than La atom shows the T c over 50 K. 5,6) It is known that external pressure can control carrier concentration in CuO 2 plane of high-T c cupper oxides. 7) In order to understand the effect of 		7.44444444444444	16.9402985074627

While the enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature is established, the character of the electronic states induced by indium doping remains poorly understood. We report a study of magneto-transport in a series of Sn1−xInxTe single crystals with 0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.45. From measurements of the Hall effect, we find that the dominant carrier type changes from hole-like to electron-like at x ∼ 0.25; one would expect electron-like carriers if the In ions have a valence of +3. For single crystals with x = 0.45, corresponding to the highest super- conducting transition temperature, pronounced Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations are observed in the normal state. In measurements of magnetoresistance, we find evidence for weak anti-localization (WAL). We attribute both the quantum oscillations and the WAL to bulk Dirac-like hole pockets, previously observed in photoemission studies, which coexist with the dominant electron-like carriers. 		2.375	73.4385964912281

To gain insight into its properties, we performed ab-initio electronic structure calculations based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT). Our results show that the density of states at the Fermi energy is mainly composed by V-d states. The McMillan formula predicts a superconducting critical temperature (T c ) of approximately 3.9 K, in excellent agreement with the experimental value at 4.1 K, indicating that superconductivity in this new compound may be explained by the electron-phonon mechanism. Calculated valence charge density maps clearly show directional bonding between Hf and V atoms with 1D highly populated V-chains, and some ionic character between Hf-Ga and V-Ga bonds. Finally, we have shown that there are electrons occupying two distinct bands at the Fermi level, with different characters, which supports experimental indications of possible multiband superconductivity. Based on the results, we propose the study of a related compound, ScV 2 Ga 4 , showing that it has similar electronic properties, but probably with a higher T c than HfV 2 Ga 4 . 		2.55555555555556	58.536231884058

K. Bao et al., arXiv: 1412.0067 (2014)], we succeeded in synthesizing an analogous compound, Rb2Cr3As3, which also crystallizes in a hexagonal lattice. The replacement of K by Rb results in an expansion of a axis by 3%, suggesting weaker interchain coupling. Linear temperature dependence of electrical resistivity shows up between 5 to 35 K, and bulk superconductivity emerges at 4.8 K. The estimated upper critical field at zero temperature exceeds the Pauli limit by a factor of two. Furthermore, the electronic specific-heat coefficient in the mixed state increases with √ H, indicating existence of nodes in the superconducting gap. Hence Rb2Cr3As3 manifests itself as another example of unconventional superconductivity in the Cr3As3- chain based systems. 		4.77777777777778	45.2325581395349
SCinTiO_1612.02502-CC.pdf	SCinTiO_1612.02502-CC.pdf	Superconductivity in higher titanium oxides Superconductivity in higher titanium oxides 	After the discovery of zero resistivity in mercury at the temperature of liquid helium, several conventional superconductors have been identified from single elements and alloys over the course of decades 1-3 . The Bardeen-Cooper- Schrieffer (BCS) theory explains the unique properties of superconductors 4 and guides materials design for achieving a higher superconducting transition temperature (TC) under the criterion of the large electron-phonon coupling constant (lep). Magnesium diboride with TC = 39 K has been discovered using this strategy 5 . A further increase in lep is ineffective in enhancing TC because the localization of electron pairs in real space results in the formation of a charge density wave, and the highest TC considered within the BCS theory is approximately 40 K. This BCS wall has been easily overcome with the demonstration of perovskite-type copper oxides 6 . Unconventional materials, including fullerenes 7 and iron pnictides 8 , have reigned over the class of high-TC superconductors. However, a conventional superconductor (sulphur hydride) recently created a new record of TC = 203 K under an ultra-high pressure 9 . Such old materials but new superconductors are again attracting significant attention 10 . Here, we report new superconductors produced from higher titanium oxides, which are Ti4O7 and g-Ti3O5 films synthesized using advanced epitaxial growth on specific oxide substrates. Their TC are 3.0 and 7.1 K, respectively. The latter is the highest known value among simple oxides. The temperature dependence of resistivity strongly depended on the growth 3 atmosphere. Higher titanium-oxide films grown under a more oxidative condition exhibited metal-insulator transition accompanied by clear hysteresis at ~150 K. The insulating phase was suppressed in the films grown under a less oxidative condition, and the superconducting phase appeared at low temperatures. These results and the previous theoretical prediction suggest that oxygen non-stoichiometry and epitaxial stabilization play key roles in the realization of bipolaronic superconductivity in these titanium oxides. Results The formation of higher titanium-oxide films was verified using x-ray diffraction (XRD). The out-of-plane XRD patterns showed intense reflections from the Ti4O7 films grown on (LaAlO3)0. 3-(SrAl0.5Ta0.5O3)0.7 (LSAT) (100) substrates and the g-Ti3O5 film grown on α-Al2O3 (0001) substrates (Figs. 2a and 2b, respectively). These substrates are insulating, non-magnetic, and exhibit high reduction resistance, providing advantages in the growth and search of a superconducting sample. However, because titanium oxides form various polymorphisms with different ratios of oxygen to titanium, their crystal structures must be carefully controlled and distinguished. Pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) with a TiOx target (x ~ 1.5) was conducted at a high temperature to tune the degree of subtle oxidation by feeding a small amount of oxygen gas or even flowing inert Ar gas. Then, we used the tilt angle c-dependence of 2q-q XRD profiles to survey the asymmetric film reflections (see Figs. S1 and S5 in Supplemental Materials). Reflections coming from the substrate and film were found at characteristic c angles. Since the intensities of the film reflections were too weak to determine the d values of interplanar spacing distances precisely, synchrotron radiation XRD measurements were also performed (see Figs. S2, S3, and S6). From the d values and c angles, we identified the Miller indices as those listed in Tables S1 and S2. In comparison to the previous structural analyses of higher titanium oxides 15,21-24 , we concluded that the films grown on LSAT (100) and a-Al2O3 (0001) substrates were Ti4O7 and 		3.5952380952381	41.5761589403973

The essential electronic physics in these materials stems from the Co layers with each layer being formed by vertex-shared CoA4 (A=S,Se,Te) tetrahedra complexes, a material genome proposed recently by us to host potential unconventional high-Tc close to a d 7 filling configuration in 3d transition metal compounds. We calculate the magnetic ground states of different transition metal compounds with this structure. It is found that (Mn,Fe,Co)-based compounds all have a G-type antiferromagnetic(AFM) insulating ground state while Ni-based compounds are paramagnetic metal. The AFM interaction is the largest in the Co-based compounds as the three t2g orbitals all strongly participate in AFM superexchange interactions. The abrupt quenching of the magnetism from the Co to Ni-based compounds is very similar to those from Fe to Co-based pnictides in which a C-type AFM state appears in the Fe-based ones but vanishes in the Co-based ones. This behavior can be considered as an electronic signature of the high-Tc gene. Upon doping, as we predicted before, this family of Co-based compounds favor a strong d-wave pairing superconducting state. 		2.04255319148936	57.375

Tc4k_interfaceBi_Ni-CC.pdf	Tc4k_interfaceBi_Ni-CC.pdf	Unconventional interfacial superconductivity in epitaxial Bi/Ni heterostructures 	Superconductivity (SC) is one of the most intriguing physical phenomena in nature. Nucleation of SC has long been considered highly unfavorable if not impossible near ferromagnetism (FM) 1-5 , in low dimensionality 6,7 and, above all, out of non-superconductor. Here we report observation of SC with TC near 4 K in Ni/Bi bilayers that defies all known paradigms of superconductivity, where neither ferromagnetic Ni film nor rhombohedra Bi film is superconducting in isolation 8 . This highly unusual SC is independent of the growth order (Ni/Bi or Bi/Ni), but highly sensitive to the constituent layer thicknesses. Most importantly, the SC, distinctively non-s pairing, is triggered from, but does not occur at, the Bi/Ni interface. Using point contact Andreev reflection (AR) 9 , we show evidences that the unique SC, naturally compatible with magnetism, is triplet p-wave pairing. This work might open a new door to explore novel SC which could lead to potential applications in superconducting spintronics 10,11 . 		1.6	95.775

Bulk superconductivity at 4.3 K has been confirmed, however, the measured superconducting fraction is relatively low probably due to the sample's intrinsic two-dimensional characteristic.

A Rietveld analysis using X-ray powder diffraction data showed that, within the resolution of the measurement, the sample was purely an infinite-layer structure without any dis- cernible impurities. The superconducting volume fraction and the transition width were greatly improved compared to those in the previous reports. Also the irreversibility field line was much higher than that of (La,Sr)2CuO4. The higher value seems to originate from the strong interlayer coupling due to the reduced average distance between the CuO2 planes. 		2.19230769230769	54.7368421052632

When the superconductivity is suppressed by high magnetic fields, the Hall coefficient has negative values in low temperatures, and the temperature region of the negative values spreads as increasing magnetic fields.

Samples with x = 0.1 and 0.2 reveal purely semiconducting resistivity behavior along c and the charge transport is close to localization within the ab-plane. A strong anisotropy in the magnetic susceptibility appears at temperatures below 100 K. Moreover magnetic ordering in c-direction with a moment of order 0.01 µB/f.u. occurs at low temperatures. On doping the low-temperature linear term of the heat capacity becomes significantly reduced and probably is dominated by spin fluctuations. Finally, the optical conductivity reveals the anisotropic character of the dc resistance, with the in-plane conductance roughly following a Drude-type behavior and an insulating response along c. 		4.72727272727273	42.025641025641

Under flowing O2-gas of a high pressure (4 bars), we have succeeded in growing single crystals of x = 0.11 with 5 mm in diameter and 20 mm in length. It has been found that both in-plane and out-of-plane electrical resistivities of the single-crystal La2−xBaxCuO4 with x = 0.11 exhibit a clear jump at ∼ 53 K. The temperature corresponds to the structural phase transition temperature between the orthorhombic mid-temperature (OMT) and tetragonal low-temperature (TLT) phases, T d2 . It has also been found that both in-plane thermoelectric power and Hall coefficient drop rapidly at T d2 and decrease below T d2 with decreasing temperature. These results are quite similar to those observed in the single-crystal La1.6−xNd0.4SrxCuO4 with x ∼ 1/8, suggesting that the so-called static stripe order of holes and spins in the CuO2 plane is formed below T d2 in La2−xBaxCuO4 with x ∼ 1/8 as well as in La1.6−xNd0.4SrxCuO4 with x ∼ 1/8. 		4.61290322580645	39.2307692307692

The pyrochlore oxide is known to be a geometrical frustrated system, which includes the tetrahedral network of magnetic ions. A large number of compounds are classified in the family of pyrochlore oxides, and these compounds exhibit a wide variety of physical properties ranging from insulator through semiconductor and from bad metal to good metal. Until now, however, no superconductivity has been reported for frustrated pyrochlore oxides. The bulk superconductivity of this compound is confirmed by measurements of the resistivity and the a. c. magnetic susceptibility. The H c2 , which is extrapolated to 0 K, is estimated as about 0.8 T, using the resistivity measurements under aplied field. The plot of H c2 vs T indicates that the Cooper pairs are composed of rather heavy quasiparticles. This fact suggests that frustrated heavy electrons become superconducting in this compound. 		4.22222222222222	24.0657894736842

Coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is observed in all the Cu doped samples studied here. The zero field susceptibility data suggests formation of a spontaneous vortex phase. Cu doping decreases the ferromagnetic Curie temperature, whereas the superconducting transition temperature increases until an optimal concentration x ∼0.1. This reflects an increase in hole transfer to the CuO2 planes and reduction of ferromagnetic order within the ruthenate layers. 		7.77777777777778	23.7428571428571

The hole doping in the CuO 2 planes, is controlled by appropriate variation of the Ce concentration. SC occurs for Ce contents of 0.4-0.8, with the highest T C =35 K for Ce=0.6. The as-prepared non-SC EuCeRuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10 (x=1) sample exhibits magnetic irreversibility below T irr =125 K and orders anti-ferromagnetically (AFM) at T M =165 K. The saturation moment at 5 K is M sat =0.89 µ B /Ru close to the expected 1 µ B for the low-spin state of Ru 5+ . Annealing under oxygen pressures, does not affect these parameters, whereas depletion of oxygen shifts both T irr and T M up to 169 and 215 K respectively. Systematic magnetic studies on Eu 2-x Ce x RuSr 2 Cu 2 O 10-δ show that T M , T irr and M sat decrease with x, and the Ce dependent magnetic-SC phase diagram is presented. A simple model for the SC state is proposed. We interpret the magnetic behavior in the framework of our ac and dc magnetic studies, and argue that: (i) the system becomes AFM ordered at T M ; (b) at T irr < T M , W-FM is induced by the canting of the Ru moments, and (c), at lower temperatures the appropriate samples become SC at T C . The magnetic features are not affected by the SC state, and the two states coexist. 		4.58974358974359	34.4525139664804

It is found that the low-temperature phonon peak (at 20 -25 K) is significantly suppressed upon Sr or Zn doping even at very low doping, though its precise doping dependences show interesting differences between the Sr and Zn dopants, or between the ab plane and the c axis. Most notably, the phonon peak in κc decreases much more quickly with Sr doping than with Zn doping, while the phonon-peak suppression in κ ab shows an opposite trend. It is discussed that the scattering of phonons by stripes is playing an important role in the damping of the phonon heat transport in lightly doped LSCO, in which static spin stripes has been observed by neutron scattering. We also show κ ab and κc data of La1.28Nd0.6Sr0.12CuO4 and La1.68Eu0.2Sr0.12CuO4 single crystals to compare with the data of the lightly doped crystals for the discussion of the role of stripes. At high temperature, the magnon peak (i.e., the peak caused by the spin heat transport near the Néel temperature) in κ ab (T ) is found to be rather robust against Zn doping, while it completely disappears with only 1% of Sr doping. 		5.45	44.5596330275229

We find that the temperature dependence of the thermopower, S(T), is different from that observed in the hole doped HTSC. In particular, we find that dS(T)/dT is positive above ~120 K. However, we show that S(T) can still be described by the same model developed for the hole doped HTSC and hence S(T) is not anomalous and does not imply phonon mediated pairing as has previously been suggested. The Cu NMR data reveal a Knight shift and spin lattice relaxation rate below T c that are inconsistent with isotropic s-wave pairing. The Cu spin lattice relaxation rate in the normal state, however, is Curie-Weiss like and is comparable to that of the optimally and overdoped hole doped HTSC, La 2-x Sr x CuO 4 . The magnitude of the Knight shift indicates that the density of states at the Fermi level is anomalously small when compared with the hole doped HTSC with the same T c , indicating that the size of ) ( f E N is of little importance in the HTSC. We find no evidence of the normal state pseudogap that is observed in the hole doped HTSC and which was recently reported to exist in the electron doped HTSC, Nd 1.85 Ce 0.15 CuO 4 , from infrared reflectance measurements. 		2.04878048780488	63.0476190476191

Besides the typical Zn-doping effects on the in-plane resistivity and the Hall angle, we demonstrate that the nature of the low-temperature normal state in the Zn-doped samples is significantly altered from that in the pristine samples under high magnetic fields. In particular, we observe nearly-isotropic negative magnetoresistance as well as an increase in the Hall coefficient at very low temperatures in non-superconducting Zn-doped samples, which we propose to be caused by the Kondo scattering from the local moments induced by Zn impurities. 		3.4	51.3382352941177

The observed shift in the present system can be relatively well ex- plained by numerical results on the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model, and suggests that the change of the electronic structure induced by hole doping is less influenced by stripe fluctuations than in LSCO. 		3.29411764705882	60.4642857142857

Both the out-of-plane and in-plane resistivity show T 2 dependence in an unusually wide range of temperatures up to room temperature. This behavior cannot be accounted for either by electron correlation or by electron-phonon scattering with high frequency optic phonons. In addition, a phase transition with a large diamagnetic signal was found in the ac susceptibility, which strongly suggests the existence of a superconducting phase below 48 mK. 		4.36363636363636	45.4479166666667

The Gd ESR spectrum of samples with ≈ 1% substitution was obtained with a broadband microwave technique that measures power absorption bolometrically from 0.5 GHz to 21 GHz. This ESR spectrum is determined by the crystal field that lifts the level degeneracy of the spin 7/2 Gd 3+ ion and details of this spectrum provide information concerning oxygen ordering in the samples. The magnetic penetration depth is obtained by relating the number of Gd ions exposed to the microwave magnetic field to the frequency-integrated inten- sity of the observed ESR transitions. This technique has allowed us to determine precise values of λ for screening currents flowing in the three crystallographic orientations (â,b andĉ) in sam- ples of GdxY1−xBa2Cu3O6+y of three different oxygen contents y = 0.993 (Tc = 89 K), y = 0.77 (Tc = 75 K) and y = 0.52 (Tc = 56 K).

An anisotropy ratio of 8 was detected for the upper critical fields with H parallel (H ab c2 ) and perpendicular (H c c2 ) to the CuO2 planes, with H ab c2 extrapolating to near the Pauli paramagnetic limit of 160 T. The longer superconducting coherence length than the lattice constant along the c-axis indicates that the orbital degrees of freedom of the pairing wavefunction are three dimensional. By contrast, low-field magnetization and specific heat measurements of Sr0.9Gd0.1CuO2 indicate a coexistence of bulk s-wave superconductivity with large moment Gd paramagnetism close to the CuO2 planes, suggesting a strong confinement of the spin degrees of freedom of the Cooper pair to the CuO2 planes. The region between H ab c2 and the irreversibility line in the magnetization, H ab irr , is anomalously large for an electron-doped high-Tc cuprate, suggesting the existence of additional quantum fluctuations perhaps due to a competing spin-density wave order. 		4.33333333333333	54.0641025641026

The low field (±20 G) superconducting hysteresis loop indicates a narrow Meissner state region within average lower critical field Bc1(T)= Bc1(0)[1 - (T/T0) 2 ], with average B ave c1 (0) = 12 G and T0 = 30 K. Full Meissner shielding signal in very low applied field indicates an ab-plane B ab c1 (0) ∼ 4 G with an estimated anisotropic parameter γ ∼ 7 for this layered system. The existence of a spontaneous vortex state between 30 K and 56 K is the result of weak-ferromagnetic order with a net spontaneous magnetic moment of ∼ 0.1 µB/Ru, which generates a weak magnetic dipole field around 10 G in the CuO2 bi-layers. The upper critical field Bc2 varies linearly as (1 -T/Tc) up to 7-T field. The vortex melting line Bm varies as (1 -T/Tm) 3.5 with melting transition temperature Tm = 39 K and a very broad vortex liquid region due to the coexistence and the interplay between superconductivity and weak-ferromagnetic order. 		8.45	24.3846153846154

Pfleiderer et al., Nature (London) 412, 58 (2001)] is due to remnants of a superconducting layer induced by spark erosion. Results of resistivity, susceptibility, specific heat and surface analysis measurements on high-quality ZrZn2 crystals show that cutting by spark erosion leaves a supercon- ducting surface layer. The resistive superconducting transition is destroyed by chemically etching a layer of 5 µm from the sample. No signature of superconductivity is observed in ρ(T ) of etched samples at the lowest current density measured, J = 675 Am −2 , and at T ≥ 45 mK. EDX analysis shows that spark-eroded surfaces are strongly Zn depleted. The simplest explanation of our results is that the superconductivity results from an alloy with higher Zr content than ZrZn2. 		3.57692307692308	42.9569892473118

In contrast to the iso-structural RuSr 2 R 1.5 Ce 0.5 Cu 2 O 10-δ (Ru-1222) system, in which superconductivity (SC) in the CuO 2 planes and weak-ferromagnetism in the Ru sub-lattice coexists, in Mo-1222, displays a competition between the two states, namely, SC vanishes when the magnetic order sets in. The contraction in the R elements leads to a change of the physical states. The light R ions (Pr and Nd) are paramagnetic down to 5 K, whereas the middle R ions (Sm and Eu) are SC at T C 18-23 K respectively. The SC charge carriers originate from the CuO 2 planes, and annealing under oxygen pressures does not affect T C . A simple model for the SC state is proposed.

The value of λ at T = 0 was found to be in the range of 250 nm to 300 nm. µSR and equilibrium magnetization measurements both reveal that at low temperatures λ is almost (at the level of 10%) independent of the applied magnetic field.

A similar upper critical magnetic field as well as a similar superconducting transition temperature of Nd 1:85 Ce 0:15 CuO 4 and Nd 2 CuO 4 shows that the addition of electrons merely influences the superconducting state.

Using the deoxygenated sample to subtract the phonon contribution, we find a broad peak in the specific heat, centered at 50 K.

Near the superconducting transition Tc(H=0)= 43 K, we find a sharp feature that is strongly suppressed when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the crystallographic c-axis. A model for 3D vortex fluctuations is used to scale magnetization measured at several magnetic fields. When the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the c-axis, the only observed effect is a slight shift in the superconducting transition temperature. 		5.3030303030303	34.3657142857143

The anhydrous parent compound Na 0.61(1) CoO 2 has two partially occupied Na sites sandwiched, in the same plane, between CoO 2 layers. When Na is removed to make the superconducting composition, the Na site that experiences the strongest Na-Co repulsion is emptied while the occupancy of the other Na site is reduced to about one third. The deuterate superconducting compound is formed by coordinating four D 2 O molecules (two above and two below) to each remaining Na ion in a way that gives Na-O distances nearly equal to those in the parent compound. One deuteron of the D 2 O molecule is hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom in the CoO 2 plane and the oxygen atom and the second deuteron of each D 2 O molecule lie approximately in a plane between the Na layer and the CoO 2 layers. This coordination of Na by four D 2 O molecules leads in a straightforward way to ordering of the Na ions and D 2 O molecules consistent with the observation of additional shorter-range scattering features in the diffraction data. The sample studied here, which has T c =4.5 K, has a refined composition of Na 0.31(3) CoO 2 •1.25(2)D 2 O, in agreement with the expected 1:4 ratio of Na to D 2 O. These results show that the optimal superconducting composition should be viewed as a specific hydrated compound, not a solid solution of Na and D 2 O (H 2 O) in Na x CoO 2 •yD 2 O. The hydrated superconducting compound may be stable over a limited range of Na and D 2 O concentration, but studies of T c and other physical properties vs. Na or D 2 O composition should be viewed with caution until it is verified that the compound remains in the same phase over the composition range of the study. 		3.83333333333333	73.1159420289855

Magnetization measurements under hydrostatic pressure up to 10.5 kbar in zirconium dodeca- boride ZrB12 superconductor (Tc ≃ 6.0 K at p = 0) were carried out. A negative pressure effect on Tc with dTc/dp = −0.0225(3) K/kbar was observed. The electron-phonon coupling constant λ el−ph decreases with increasing pressure with d ln λ el−ph /dp ≃ −0.20%/kbar. The magnetic field penetration depth λ was studied in the Meissner state and, therefore, probes only the surface of the sample. The absolute values of λ and the superconducting energy gap at ambient pressure and zero temperature were found to be λ(0) =140(30) nm and ∆0 =1.251(9) meV, respectively. ∆0 scales linearly with Tc as 2∆0/kBTc = 4.79(1). The studies of the pressure effect on λ reveal that λ −2 increases with pressure with d ln λ −2 (0)/dp = 0.60(23) %/kbar. This effect can not be explained within the framework of conventional adiabatic electron-phonon pairing, suggesting that close to the surface, an unconventional non-adiabatic character of the electron-phonon coupling takes place. 		3.26315789473684	59.6451612903226

Resistivity, ρ(T), for a number of overdoped to underdoped samples with y ≥ 0.055 showed clear downturns at a characteristic temperature similar to that found at T * in Zn-free underdoped samples because of the presence of the pseudogap. Contrary to the widely observed behavior for underdoped cuprates at lower Zn contents (where the pseudogap energy increases almost linearly with decreasing p in the same way as for the Zn-free compounds), this apparent pseudogap temperature at high Zn content showed very little or no p-dependence. It also increases systematically with increasing Zn concentration in the CuO 2 planes. This anomalous behavior appears quite abruptly, e.g., samples with y ≤ 0.05 exhibit the usual T * (p) behavior. AC susceptibility of these heavily disordered samples showed the superfluid density to be extremely low. Magneto-transport, ρ(T,H), measurements are provisionally interpreted in terms of high-strength pinning centers for vortices in these samples. We also discuss various possible scenarios that might lead to a Zn induced pseudogap in the cuprates. 		6.94117647058824	56.0593220338983

In the AC susceptibility of a mono-crystal, we observed large supercooling, as well as positive peaks in the real part of the susceptibility indicating the reversibility of magnetic process. These observations reveal that Ag5Pb2O6 is probably the first oxide that shows type-I superconductivity. Evaluation of the superconducting parameters not only gives confirming evidence of type-I superconductivity, but also indicates that it is a dirty-limit superconductor.

The new superconductor has three layers of CoO 6 octahedra per crystallographic unit cell, in contrast to the previously reported two-layer superconductor. The three-layer cell occurs because the relative orientations of neighboring CoO 2 layers are distinctly different from what is seen in the two-layer superconducting phase. This type of structural difference in materials that are otherwise chemically and structurally identical is not possible to attain on the layered copper oxide superconductors.

Quantitative carbon analysis revealed that carbon could be introduced into Y-123 from both the precursor and the sintering gas. Nearly carbon-free (< 200 ppm) samples were prepared from a vacuum-treated precursor by sintered at 900 ˚C and cooling with 20 ˚C /min in flowing oxygen gas. The lower T c (= 88 K) and higher oxygen content (y = 6.98) strongly suggested the overdoping state, which was supported by the temperature dependence of resisitivity and thermoelectric power. The nuclear quadrapole resonance spectra and the Raman scattering spectra indicated that there was almost no oxygen defect in the Cu-O chain in these samples. On the other hand, in the same cooling condition, the samples sintered in air stayed at optimal doping level with T c = 93 K, and the intentionally carbon-doped sample was in the underdoping state. It is revealed that about 60% of incorporated carbon was substituted for Cu at the chain site in the form of CO 3 2+ , and the rest remains at the grain boundary as carbonate impurities. Such incorporation affected the oxygen absorption process in Y-123. It turned out that the oxygen content in Y-123 cannot be controlled only by the annealing temperature and the oxygen partial pressure but also by the incorporated carbon concentration. 		1.94915254237288	44.8434782608696

The electronic contribution to the specific heat, γ, is found to be 12.2 mJ/mol-K 2 . The feature at the superconducting transition is rather sharp, becoming broad and strongly suppressed in an applied magnetic field. The data indicate a residual normal state electronic specific heat at low temperatures, implying that there is a sizable population of normal state electrons in the samples even below T c . Inhomogeneity in the Na content, to which the superconducting state is exquisitely sensitive, appears to be the most likely explanation for these results. These results further indicate that special sample handling is required for an accurate characterization of the superconducting state in this material. 		5	35.2285714285714

Magnetisation measurements in pulsed fields up to 50 T in the temperature range 4.2 -90 K revealed that: (i) in fields up to µ 0 20 H ≈ T the critical current J c (H,T) is considerably enhanced and (ii) down to temperatures T ~ 40 K the irreversibility field H irr (T) is strongly increased. The field range and magnitude of the J c (H,T) and H irr (T) enhancement increase with increasing irradiation dose. To interpret these observations, an effective matching field B φ• was defined. Moreover, introducing columnar defects also changes the pinning force f p qualitatively. Due to stronger pinning of flux lines by the amorphous defects, the superconducting critical parameters largely exceed those associated with the defect structures in the unirradiated as-grown material: 		1.57575757575758	114.115384615385
PHC2640145-CC.pdf	PHC2640145-CC.pdf	Poster Presentation 	HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+δ superconductor (Hg-1223) still has the highest critical temperature in various superconductors, which is a layered perovskite with the space group of P4/mmm. A structural unit of cation-layers is stacked in a sequence of -HgO-BaO-CuO-Ca-along the c-axis. The substitution of Hg by Pb enhances the stability of the Hg-1223 phase because the high steam pressure of Hg lowers the chemical stability in synthesis. However, the doping into Hg layers is related to an interstitial oxygen defect. On the other hand, the substitution of Ba by Sr improves the hole doping of CuO2 planes. Thus, the element substitution in Hg and Ba sites becomes a key factor in synthesizing high-quality superconductors. Therefore, the cation distribution in the two sites has been examined by the two- wavelengths anomalous dispersion (TWAD) method of synchrotron X-ray resonant scattering. Single crystals of Hg-1223 were grown at T = 1130 K by the liquid-assisted solid-state recrystallization method from the precursor powder prepared by spray drying or evaporation of the nitrate solutions. Oxygen contents in the precursors were determined by iodometric titrations. Four samples of Hg0.45Pb0.were selected for single- crystal intensity measurements. A conventional measurement to determine the Ba-site occupancy was made to use a Rigaku AFC-5 four-circle diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation. After the absorption correction by the arbitrary-shape grid-integration method, crystal-structure refinements were successfully performed with R factors ranging 6.4 to 6.7 %. The site preference of Hg, Pb and Cu in the Hg site was determined with a vertical-type four-circle diffractometer in PF-BL-10A, where wavelengths of λ = 1.3906 and 1.0191 Å were used at Cu K and Hg LIII absorption edges, respectively. In the TWAD method with least-squares calculations, a variation of the residual factors gives a minimum against the contents of Hg or Cu, suggesting, for example, that Cu does not occupy the Hg site for all samples. In the presentation the site preference and structural change will be discussed in the aspects of superconductivity. 		1.33333333333333	111.75

Except for the stoichiometric Y-124 phase, the oxygen concentration was optimized in order to obtain the highest value of the critical temperature for which the normal-state susceptibility becomes temperature independent. Using the simple London model, we are able to fit the reversible magnetization M(T, H) outside the region near Tc with good accuracy for the nearly three-dimensional YBaCuO phases. For the very anisotropic BiSrCaCuO and TlBaCaCuO phases, we have to include an additional term to take into account the fluctuations of vortices. An important result is that Y-123 exhibits a critical field clearly higher than those of the BiSrCaCuO or TlBaCaCuO phases. We obtain for the Y-123 phase a slope and an extrapolated µoH C2,C (0) = 280 T. 		1.45454545454545	59.4875

The observed reduction in superconducting transition temperature, T c , in this system with increasing Mo content can be attributed to the decrease in hole concentration. Magnetization measurements as a function of temperature and field (H), exhibit an M-H hysteresis loop which indicates moderate flux pinning, which is thought due to pinning centers created by Mo substitution at Cu sites. The critical current density, J c , deduced from the M-H data satisfies the flux creep model. 		5.625	32.5925925925926

In both series a T c enhancement of about 40 K is observed when Sr substitutes Ba from y = 0 to y = 1.0. The y = 0 compound of the first series is the non superconducting Hg 2 Ba 2 YCu 2 O 8−δ prototype. In the second series, this y = 0 compound is already superconducting at 21 K. Indeed the members of this series present a higher charge carrier density in their CuO 2 superconducting planes than their homologues of the first series due to the doping introduced by the substitution of 20 % of Y by Ca. The compounds of both series were synthesized in high pressure (3.5 GPa) -high temperature (950 - 1050˚C) conditions. In both cases Sr substitution was successful up to the full replacement of Ba (y = 1.0).

The samples with x ≤0.60 crystallize in an orthorhombic structure (with orthorhombic distortion decreasing with increasing x), while the samples with x=0.80 and 1.0 crystallize in a pseudo tetragonal structure. Resistance (R) measurements as a function of temperature (T) show that x = 0.0 sample is highly semiconducting with R 2K /R 300K ratio of ~ 65. This ratio decreases to only ~23 and 5 for x=0.20 and x=0.4 samples, respectively. Further, the x=0.60 sample shows onset of a broad superconducting transition temperature (T c onset ) at around 20 K without achieving the T c R=0 state down to 2 K. The T c R=0 state is observed in x = 0.80 and 1.00 samples at around 5 and 14 K, respectively.

The decreasing rates |dT c /dx| are of the order of 1 K/% and too small to be explained by the pair breaking mechanism for the anisotropic order parameters by non-magnetic impurities. Brief arguments are given on possible origins of the T c suppression. 		3.09677419354839	41.6666666666667
JPS0723041-CC.pdf	JPS0723041-CC.pdf	Unconventional Superconductivity and Nearly Ferromagnetic Spin Fluctuations in Na x CoO 2 • yH 2 O 	Co NQR studies were performed in recently discovered superconductor NaxCoO2•yH2O to investigate physical properties in the superconducting (SC) and normal states. Two samples from the same NaxCoO2 were examined, SC bilayer-hydrate sample with Tc ∼ 4.7 K and non-SC monolayer-hydrate sample. From the measurement of nuclear-spin lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 in the SC sample, it was found that the coherence peak is absent just below Tc and that 1/T1 is proportional to temperature far below Tc. These results, which are in qualitatively agreement with the previous result by Fujimoto et al., suggest strongly that unconventional superconductivity is realized in this compound. In the normal state, 1/T1T of the SC sample shows gradual increase below 100K down to Tc, whereas 1/T1T of the non-SC sample shows the Korringa behavior in this temperature range. From the comparison between 1/T1T and χ bulk in the SC sample, the increase of 1/T1T is attributed to nearly ferromagnetic fluctuations. These remarkable findings suggest that the SC sample possesses nearly ferromagnetic fluctuations, which are possibly related with the unconventional superconductivity in this compound. The implication of this finding is discussed. 		5.58823529411765	37.5894736842105

A pronounced OIE on λ −2 ab (0) was observed with a relative isotope shift of ∆λ −2 ab /λ −2 ab = −5(2)% for x = 0.3 and -9(2)% for x = 0.4. It arises mainly from the oxygen-mass dependence of the in-plane effective mass m * ab . The OIE exponents of Tc and of λ −2 ab (0) exhibit a relation that appears to be generic for cuprate superconductors. 		4.55555555555556	46.719512195122

We present electron-tunneling spectroscopy of slightly overdoped Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8-x (Bi2212) single crystals with T c = 87 -90 K in a temperature range between 14 K and 290 K using a break-junction technique. The pseudogap which has been detected above T c appears at T* ≈ 280 K. The analysis of the spectra shows that there is a contribution to the pseudogap above T c , which disappears approximately at 110 -115 K. We associate this contribution with the presence of incoherent Cooper pairs. 		8.15384615384615	26.8018867924528

The absolute values of the conductivity in the normal state σ n and of the low temperature penetration depths λ(0) were measured for a number of different samples of the YBaCuO family. We found a striking correlation between σ n and λ −2 regardless of doping, oxygen reduction or defects, thus providing a simple method to predict the superconducting penetration depth and to have an estimate of the sample quality by measuring the normal-state conductivity. 		1.17647058823529	136

The tempera- ture dependence of the magnetic penetration depth (λ) is consistent with a nearly isotropic superconducting order parameter, although a slight dis- crepancy which is dependent on the details in the analysis may be present. This is also supported by the relatively weak field dependence of λ. 		2.65217391304348	51.5409836065574

The Knight shift K estimated from the observed spectra for powder sample exhibits almost temperature(T)-independent behavior above T c and decreases with decreasing T below T c . This result and the existence of the coherence peak in the spin-lattice-relaxation-rate versus T curve reported by the present authors indicate, naively speaking, that the singlet order parameter with s-wave symmetry is realized in Na x CoO 2 ⋅yH 2 O. Differences of the observed behaviors between the spectra of the non-aligned sample and the one aligned in epoxy adhesive by applying the external magnetic field are discussed. 		2.8	45.8571428571429

The temperature dependence of the resistivity shows metal- lic behavior from room temperature to the superconducting transition temperature Tc of 4.5 K. Sharp resistive transition, zero resistivity and almost perfect superconducting volume fraction below Tc indicate the good quality and the bulk superconductivity of the single crystal. The upper critical field Hc2 and the coherence length ξ are obtained from the resistive transitions in magnetic field parallel to the c-axis and the ab-plane. The anisotropy of ξ, ξ ab /ξc = 12 nm/1.3 nm ≃ 9.2, suggests that this material is considered to be an anisotropic three dimensional superconductor. In the field parallel to the ab-plane, Hc2 seems to be suppressed to the value of Pauli paramagnetic limit. It may indicate the spin singlet superconductivity in the cobalt oxide. 		5.8125	37.752688172043

We found remarkably large anisotropy of the uniaxial pressure effect not only between the in-plane and out-of-plane pressures but also within the CuO2-plane. When the pressure is applied along the tetragonal [110] direction, we found the largest pressure effect ever observed in cuprates, dTc/dP [110] ∼ 2.5 K/kbar, while the change of Tc was not appreciable when applied along [100]. This substantial in-plane anisotropy is attributed to an intimate link between the symmetry of the one-dimensional stripes and that of the strain produced within the CuO2 plane. 		3.58823529411765	55.6229508196721
