# LangChain integration for SAP HANA Cloud

## About this project

Integrates LangChain with SAP HANA Cloud to make use of vector search, knowledge graph, and further in-database capabilities as part of LLM-driven applications.

## Requirements and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python Environment**: Ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher installed.
- **SAP HANA Cloud**: Access to a running SAP HANA Cloud instance.


### Installation

Install the LangChain SAP HANA Cloud integration package using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -U langchain-sap-hana-cloud
```

### Setting Up Vectorstore

The `HanaDB` class is used to connect to SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine.

Hereâ€™s how to set up the connection and initialize the vector store:

```python
from langchain_sap_hana_cloud import HanaDB
from hdbcli import dbapi

# use a LangChain Embeddings class
embeddings = ...  

# Establish the SAP HANA Cloud connection
connection = dbapi.connect(
    address="<hostname>",
    port=3<NN>MM,
    user="<username>",
    password="<password>"
)

# Initialize the HanaDB vector store
vectorstore = HanaDB(
    connection=connection,
    embeddings=embeddings,
    table_name="<table_name>"  # Optional: Default is "EMBEDDINGS"
)

```
