class PipelineStage(ThreadBase):
    """
    A pipeline stage that processes data through a callback function in a separate thread.

    This class allows data to be pushed to an input queue, where it is processed
    by the provided callback function, and the result is then placed in an output
    queue. This can be useful for concurrent processing of tasks in a pipeline
    fashion.

    The pipeline runs indefinetely, until .stop() is called.

    Args:

        callback (Callable): The function (or callable) that processes input data
                              and produces output. The callback should accept one
                              argument and return the processed result.

    Raises:

        ThreadBase.CallableException: If the provided callback is not callable.

    EmptyException = queue.Empty
    """
    Raised when one of the following conditions happens:
    - get(block=False) is called, and there is no input in IN_QUEUE
    - get(timeout=value) and timeout exceeded (no input received within timeout time frame)
    """

    Raised when one of the following conditions happens:
    - put(block=False) is called and there is no available space in the OUT_QUEUE
