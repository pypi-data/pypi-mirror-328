class Pipeline(ThreadBase):
    """
    A pipeline that processes data through a callback function in a separate thread.

    This class allows data to be pushed to an input queue, where it is processed 
    by the provided callback function, and the result is then placed in an output 
    queue. This can be useful for concurrent processing of tasks in a pipeline 
    fashion.

    Args:

        callback (Callable): The function (or callable) that processes input data 
                              and produces output. The callback should accept one 
                              argument and return the processed result.

    Raises:

        Exception: If the provided callback is not callable.
