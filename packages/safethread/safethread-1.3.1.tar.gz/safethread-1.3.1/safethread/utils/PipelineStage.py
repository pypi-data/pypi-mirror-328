class PipelineStage:
    """
    A pipeline stage that processes data through a callback function.
    It can run N separate threads to read and write data in parallel.

    This class allows data to be pushed to an input queue, where it is processed
    by the provided callback function, and the result is then placed in an output
    queue. This can be useful for concurrent processing of tasks in a pipeline
    fashion.

    The pipeline runs indefinetely, until .stop() is called.

        callback (Callable): The function (or callable) that processes input data

                              argument and return the processed result.
