``safethread`` is a Python package that wraps common Python data structures in thread-safe classes, providing utilities for thread-safe operations and synchronization mechanisms. It includes custom data structures designed to ensure thread safety when used in multi-threaded programming.

## Features

- **Thread-Safe Data Structures**: `SafeList`, `SafeDict`, `SafeTuple`, `SafeSet`, among others.
- **Thread Synchronization**: Built-in locking mechanisms to ensure safe operations in multithreaded environments.
- **Utility Methods**: Additional helpers and utilities for threading and synchronization.

## Installation

You can install ``safethread`` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install safethread
```

## Usage

```python
from safethread.datatype import SafeList, SafeDict, SafeSet

# Using SafeList
safe_list = SafeList()
safe_list.append(1)
print(safe_list[0])  # Output: 1

# Using SafeDict
safe_dict = SafeDict()
safe_dict['key'] = 'value'
print(safe_dict['key'])  # Output: 'value'

# Using SafeSet
safe_set = SafeSet(['x','y'])
safe_set.add('z')
print('z' in safe_set)  # Output: True
```
