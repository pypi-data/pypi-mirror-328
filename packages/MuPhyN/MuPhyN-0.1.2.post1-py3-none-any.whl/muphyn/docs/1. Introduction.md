MatLab/Simulink is a very powerful tool that allows engineers to simulate complex multi-physical systems. Free and open-source tools exist such as [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org/) with [Xcos](https://www.scilab.org/software/xcos) or [Octave](https://octave.org/) that tries to be compatible with MatLab/Simulink, but the approach of MuPhyN is to replicate the power and ease of use of the MatLab/Simulink combination by using (i)Python instead of MatLab combined with the MuPhyN graphical interface instead of Simulink.

Free libraries such as scipy and numpy offer numerical tools that can replicate most of MatLab toolboxes, and implementing them into new boxes in MuPhyN is trivial thanks to easily expandables libraries of boxes.

MuPhyn is capable of running into an iPython interactive shell while having access to the namespace of the shell. This means that python code can be run in the shell to dynamically generate modelisation parameters that can be directly used into the MuPhyN model of the simulated system.

MuPhyN is also intendend to be expandable to other simulation tools. A connection to OpenModelica is being developed to simulate different kinds of systems with lumped elements. Connection to open source finite element analysis softwares such as FEATools or field solver tools like openEMS or FEMM are also considered.

it is based on a Qt interface and uses a simulator core. It is fully written in Python and uses YAML as the descriptive language. The library feature proposed allows users to add as many boxes and schedulers as they want.
