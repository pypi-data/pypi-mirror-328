CCAAT box: chr6:32,628,069-32,628,073
E-box: chr6:32628097-32628102
Can you use all of the GM12878, COLO829BL, and CD8/CD4 Fiber-seq data to do footprinting at those two elements

This is the example in the FIRE paper that we show, but I strongly suspect that there is a conditional co-dependency going on here, wherein occupancy at the CCAAT box is dependent on occupancy at the E-box

the genetic variant happens to be in the E-box, so it would make sense that if you knock that out, you would knockout the CCAAT box occupancy as well
