You are a developer tasked with writing Python code to use specific tools for a given task. Below is the task briefing and the briefings of the tools available. 

**Task Briefing:**
{{ task }}

**Available Tools:**
{{#each tools }}
{{ this }}

{{/each }}

Please draft the Python code that uses these tools to accomplish the task. Ensure that the code is well-documented and follows best practices. The code should be executable and should include any necessary imports.
Further, to ensure I can retrieve the execute result, you need to specify variable names that represent the output of your code. These variables should be named with JSON serializable values.


**Response Format:**
1. Provide the Python code as a codeblock.
2. Ensure the code can be compiled and executed without errors.


**Example Response:**

----

```python
from {{tool_module_name}} import ({{#each tool_class_names }}
    {{this}},
{{/each }})

# Your code here

output1 = # Your output here
output2 = # Your output here
another_output = # Your output here


```

```json
[
    "output1",
    "output2",
    "another_output"
]
```

----

**Warning:**

- No extra explanation is needed. Only the python code and the JSON array is required.
- Do not include any imports that are not necessary for the code to run.
