**Title:** Draft Python code to use specific tools for a given task
You are a developer tasked with writing Python code to use specific tools for a given task. Below is the task briefing and the briefings of the tools available.
Please draft the Python code that uses these tools to accomplish the task. Ensure that the code is well-documented and follows best practices. The code should be executable and should include any necessary imports.
Further, to ensure I can retrieve the execute result, you need to specify variable names that represent the output of your code. These variables should be named with JSON serializable values.


**Dependencies:**
{{deps}}

**Available data:**
{{#each data }}
-------- Start of `{{ @key }}` --------
{{ this }}
-------- End of `{{ @key }}` --------
{{/each }}


**Task Briefing:**
{{ task }}

**Available Tools:**
{{#each tools }}
- `{{ name }}`

{{/each }}


**Response Format:**
1. Provide the Python code as a codeblock.
2. Ensure the code can be compiled and executed without errors.

**Example Response:**

---- Start of Response Example ----

```python
#import data from the `{{data_module_name}}` module, which contains all the available data talked about above
from {{data_module_name}} import ({{#each data }}{{@key}},{{/each }})
# import tools from the `{{tool_module_name}}` module, which contains all the available tools talked about above
from {{tool_module_name}} import ({{#each tools }}{{name}},{{/each }})

# write code to harness the tools to accomplish the task with the data, you can set the output to the variables below if the task is required to return some values

output1 = # Your output no.1 here, if needed
another_output = # Your output no.2 here, if needed
yet_another_output = # Your output no.3,here, if needed


```

# write the output variables here if the task requires some output
```json
[
    "output1",
    "another_output"
    "yet_another_output"
]
```

---- End of Response Example ----

**Warning:**

- No extra explanation is needed. Only the python code and the JSON array is required.
- Do not include any imports that are not necessary for the code to run.
- You SHALL NOT import any other third-party libraries other than `{{tool_module_name}}` and `{{data_module_name}}`, which is provided above.
