Client lib for the identity service


## Manual deployment
Since we don't have a CI/CD pipeline set up right now. You'll have to follow the following steps to release

1. Do your changes
2. Install `bumpversion` and `twine`
```
pip install twine bumpversion
```
3. Bump the version using `bumpversion`
```
bumpversion patch
```
or as an example:
```
bumpversion --new-version 1.1.26 patch
```
4. A commit should be made automatically, just push
```
git push
```
5. Build using setup.py
```
python setup.py sdist
```
6. Push to pypi using twine
```
twine upload dist/*
```
Use `1password` to find the credentials for pypi.

In order to upload, we have 2FA and the following needs to be done:
- username should be "\_\_token__"
- password should be the Access Token value
