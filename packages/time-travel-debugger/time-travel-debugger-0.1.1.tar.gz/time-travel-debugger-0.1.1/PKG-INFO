# Time-Travel Debugger 🚀

A Python library that allows step-backward debugging, making debugging more visual and interactive. This tool helps developers inspect past states of their program without restarting execution, enabling efficient debugging.

## 📌 How This Idea Came to Mind

While solving problems on **LeetCode**, I often performed **dry runs** to manually track variable changes. I realized that a tool that could **rewind execution steps** and visually display variable changes would make debugging much easier. This led me to create **Time-Travel Debugger**—a library that allows developers to **step backward and forward** in execution history seamlessly.

## ✨ Features
- Step **forward** and **backward** through execution history.
- View **variable changes** at each step.
- Set **breakpoints** for controlled debugging.
- Interactive **CLI mode** with visual debugging powered by `rich`.

## 🔧 Installation
```
pip install time-travel-debugger
```

## 🚀 Usage
```python
from time_travel_debugger import TimeTravelDebugger

def sample_function():
    a = 10
    b = a + 5
    c = b * 2
    d = c - 3
    print("Final result:", d)

# Initialize debugger
debugger = TimeTravelDebugger()

debugger.start_debugging(sample_function)

debugger.debugger_cli()
```

## 🛠️ Debugging Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `f`     | Step **forward** to the next execution state |
| `b`     | Step **backward** to the previous state |
| `q`     | **Quit** the debugger |
