Injection of domain expert knowledge has been shown to improve the accuracy with which Single-GENECI optimises consensus between different gene regulatory network inference techniques.\n\n<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/AdrianSeguraOrtiz/GENECI/raw/v-1.5.1/docs/diagram.svg"></div>\n\n# Prerequisites\n\n- Python => 3.9\n- Docker\n\n# Instalation\n\n```sh\npip install geneci==1.5.2\n```\n\n# Integrated techniques\n\nThe same as those contemplated in [Single-GENECI](https://github.com/AdrianSeguraOrtiz/Single-GENECI)\n\n# Example procedure\n\n1. **Download simulated expression data and their respective gold standards**. As in [Single-GENECI](https://github.com/AdrianSeguraOrtiz/Single-GENECI)\n\n2. **Inference and consensus** of networks for the selected expression data. Unlike in [Single-GENECI](https://github.com/AdrianSeguraOrtiz/Single-GENECI) in this case a list of known interactions can be specified via the `--known-interactions` parameter by providing a txt or csv file with the following structure:\n\n```txt\nG1,G2,1\nG1,G3,1\nG3,G4,1\n...\n```\n\nIn addition, the `--memetic-distance-type` parameter is also incorporated to consider **one**, **some** or **all** of the known interactions in each iteration of the local search phase, and the `--memetic-probability` parameter to determine the probability with which an individual is subjected to it.\n\n- **Form 1**: Procedure prefixed by the command run\n\n```sh\ngeneci run --expression-data input_data/DREAM4/EXP/dream4_010_01_exp.csv \\\n           --technique aracne --technique bc3net --technique c3net \\\n           --technique clr --technique genie3_rf --technique genie3_gbm \\\n           --technique genie3_et --technique mrnet --technique mrnetb \\\n           --technique pcit --technique tigress --technique kboost \\\n           --known-interactions known_interactions.txt --memetic-distance-type all \\\n           --memetic-probability 0.5\n```\n\n- **Form 2**: Division of the procedure into several commands\n\n```sh\n# 1. Inference using individual techniques\ngeneci infer-network --expression-data input_data/DREAM4/EXP/dream4_010_01_exp.csv \\\n                     --technique aracne --technique bc3net --technique c3net --technique clr --technique mrnet \\\n                     --technique mrnetb --technique genie3_rf --technique genie3_gbm --technique genie3_et \\\n                     --technique pcit --technique tigress --technique kboost\n\n# 2. Optimize the assembly of the trust lists resulting from the above command\ngeneci optimize-ensemble --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_ARACNE.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_BC3NET.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_C3NET.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_CLR.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_GENIE3_RF.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_GENIE3_GBM.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_GENIE3_ET.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_MRNET.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_MRNETB.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_PCIT.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_TIGRESS.csv \\\n                         --confidence-list inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/lists/GRN_KBOOST.csv \\\n                         --gene-names inferred_networks/dream4_010_01_exp/gene_names.txt \\\n                         --known-interactions known_interactions.txt --memetic-distance-type all \\\n                         --memetic-probability 0.5\n```\n\n3. **Representation** of inferred networks. As in [Single-GENECI](https://github.com/AdrianSeguraOrtiz/Single-GENECI)\n4. **Evaluation** of the quality of the inferred gene network with respect to the gold standard. As in [Single-GENECI](https://github.com/AdrianSeguraOrtiz/Single-GENECI)\n5. **Binarization** of the inferred gene network. As in [Single-GENECI](https://github.com/AdrianSeguraOrtiz/Single-GENECI)\n\n\n# CLI\n\n**Usage**:\n\n```console\n$ [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n```\n\n**Options**:\n\n* `--install-completion`: Install completion for the current shell.\n* `--show-completion`: Show completion for the current shell, to copy it or customize the installation.\n* `--help`: Show this message and exit.\n\n**Commands**:\n\n* `apply-cut`: Converts a list of confidence values into a binary matrix that represents the final gene network.\n* `draw-network`: Draw gene regulatory networks from confidence lists.\n* `evaluate`: Evaluate the accuracy of the inferred network with respect to its gold standard.\n* `extract-data`: Extract data from different simulators and known challenges.

Genes are distributed in rows and experimental conditions (time series) in columns.  [required]\n* `--known-interactions PATH`: Path to the CSV file with the known interactions between genes.
