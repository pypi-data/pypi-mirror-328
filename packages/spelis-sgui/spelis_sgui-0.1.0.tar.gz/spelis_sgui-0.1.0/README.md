## Example Usage
```python

from pyray import * # Raylib

init_window(800,600,"SGUI Example")
gui.init() # initialize the library after raylib
win = gui.Window(10,10,150,150,"My Window!") # create a window

while not window_should_close(): # raylib drawing functions
    begin_drawing()
    clear_background(BLACK)
    gui.NotifTick() # update the notifications (optional)
    with win: # this is a context manager that sets the window as the current window
        gui.label("Hello World!") # displays a little label inside the window
    end_drawing()

close_window()
```
