# templatepy
Template repo for python repositories & PyPi integration
---
**Version: "0.2.9"**


## Usage
1. **Change** files according to overview in `TODO` below
2. **Develop** package...
3. **Install** package:
   - static/normal install: `pip install .`
   - editable install:`pip install -e .`
   - dev install: `pip install -e .[dev]` (some terminals require to escape brackets with ` \ ` as `\[`, esp. zsh)



## File overview


### General
- `LICENSE`: license text

- `README.md`: [Github-flavored markdown] file

- `templatepy`: placeholder folder for any python package that is configured for install via `setup.cfg` and `pyproject.toml`
  - `__init__.py`: contains basic package info and example function that is called by console entrypoint (see `setup.cfg`)
  - `example.data.file.config`: a file to demonstrate that data files are included based on `setup.cfg` criteria
  - `example.data.file.test-extension-yu48`: a file to demonstrate data exclusion via `setup.py`


### Testing
- `tests`: placeholder folder for unit/integration tests and associated data
- `pytest.ini`: config for testing framework with `pytest` and `coverage` plugin (`pytest-cov`)


### Packaging System (see: [packaging] and [pyproject.toml])

- **`MANIFEST.in`**:
  Defines additional files to include/exclude in the build (if not automatically detected).

- **`pyproject.toml`**:
  Central configuration file that replaces the traditional `setup.cfg` and `setup.py` files:
  - **Build System**: Specifies the build system requirements and configuration, as defined in [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) and [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/).
  - **Package Metadata**: Includes the project's metadata (name, version, dependencies, etc.).
  - **Code Formatting**: Configuration for tools like [ruff] and [mypy] (if used).
  - **Optional Dependencies**: Organizes extra dependencies for development or other environments.

- **`setup.py`**:
  Legacy file retained only for backward compatibility if needed (e.g., older tooling). New projects should avoid it entirely.


## CI Workflow Overview

The CI workflow is triggered on push to `main` or when a tag is created. It ensures code quality and automates the release process:

1. **Linting and Testing**:
   - `lint`: Checks code style with `black` and `flake8`, runs pre-commit hooks.
   - `test`: Runs tests with `pytest` and generates coverage reports.

2. **Tag Validation**:
   - `check-tag`: Verifies that the tag is valid (not `dev` or `rc`) before proceeding.

3. **Release Creation**:
   - `release`: Creates a GitHub release when the tag is valid.

4. **Deployment to PyPI**:
   - `deploy`: Builds and uploads the package to PyPI using `twine`.

The pipeline ensures code quality, passing tests, and automated deployment on new releases.

### Testing CI Locally

- Install `act`:
  - **macOS/Linux**: `brew install act` / `sudo apt install act`
  - **Windows**: Download from [act GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases) and follow the installation instructions.
- Ensure Docker is installed and running. Download from [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker).
- Run the CI workflow with `act`:
  ```bash
  act push
  act push --verbose  # very verbose output !
  ```


### Code maintenance (linting/formatting/github)
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: use [pre-commit] to run code formatting (e.g. with [black] and `flake8`) and PEP compliance checks
  - Install pre-commit hook with `pre-commit install` (Note: only installs it in the current virtual environment)
  - Run it manually with `pre-commit run --all` or leave it to run on commit (requires to re-stage changed files!)

- `.github`: folder that contains github automation workflows and issues templates

- `.gitignore`: ignored files/folders in git tools

- `.bumpversion.cfg`:  config for [bump2version]

## TODO for **adapting** template to new project

- [ ] Change package name:
  - (1) Rename the `templatepy` folder.
  - (2) Update all occurrences  of `templatepy` in `README.md`.
  - (3) Update the `name` field in `pyproject.toml`.
  - (4) (optional) Update `.github/workflows` files.
  - (5) Reset version references in `pyproject.toml` and `templatepy/__init__.py` to `0.0.0.dev0`.
- [ ] Update project author and metadata details in `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, and `templatepy/__init__.py`.
- [ ] Update the license holder in the `LICENSE` file.
- [ ] Update `README.md` badge paths at the top.
- [ ] Verify inclusions/exclusions of installable files/folders in `MANIFEST.in` and `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.setuptools]`.
- [ ] Ensure `.gitignore` contains relevant entries for the new project.
- [ ] Add all version string locations to `[tool.bump2version]` in `pyproject.toml`.
  - Use syntax like `[bumpversion:file:templatepy/__init__.py]` to specify locations for version updates.
- [ ] To upload to [PyPI], follow the instructions in the section below.
- [ ] To upload to [Zenodo] (if the repository is for a publication):
  - (1) Connect Zenodo to your GitHub account.
  - (2) Enable Zenodo integration for the repository (Zenodo requires the repository to be **public**).
  - (3) Create a new GitHub release (manually or via `.github/workflows/CI.yaml`).
  - (4) Wait for Zenodo to sync and assign a DOI (this usually takes about a minute).
  - (5) Add the DOI badge to `README.md`.


## Workflow for Automatically Uploading Package to [PyPI] or [Test PyPI]

1. **Generate a PyPI API Key**:
   - Go to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and create a new API key, either specific to the repository or a general-purpose key.

2. **Add the API Key to GitHub**:
   - In your repository's settings on [GitHub](https://github.com/):
     - Navigate to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
     - Add a new **Actions secret** with the name `TWINE_API_KEY`.
     - Paste the PyPI API key into the secret's value field.

3. **Create a New Release**:
   - On [GitHub](https://github.com/), create a new release manually via the **Releases** page.
     - Use a version number without a release extension (e.g., `x.y.z`).
   - Alternatively, trigger the GitHub workflow configured for releasing by incrementing the version with `bump2version` (see info below)
   - Desperately, manually update the version strings in the relevant files and add git commit tag to trigger the release workflow on push

The package will then be automatically uploaded to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) or [Test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) as configured in your CI/CD workflow.


## Using `bump2version` for Versioning

`bump2version` is used to increment version numbers based on semantic versioning. Hereâ€™s how you can use it with the current setup to trigger a release:

1. **Bumping the Minor Version**:
   Increment the minor version (e.g., from `v1.2.3` to `v1.3.0`):
   ```bash
   # Bumping the minor Version:
   bump2version minor

   # Bumping the major version (e.g., from v1.2.3 to v2.0.0):
   bump2version major

   # Bumping for a release Version (e.g., from v1.0.0.dev to v1.0.0.rc or v1.0.0):
   bump2version release
   ```

## Github Flow overview

1) Create a new feature branch from main using git checkout -b.
2) Make and commit a dummy change (e.g., adding a file).
3) Use bumpversion to bump the version (you can adjust patch, minor, or major based on what change you want), and create a release tag.
4) Push both the feature branch and the release tag to the remote repository.
5) Open a pull request using GitHub CLI (gh pr create) or the GitHub UI to merge the feature branch into main.
6) Review the pull request online or in the CLI (e.g.: `gh pr list`, `gh pr view <nr>`, `gh pr merge <nr> --merge --delete-branch`)
7) After the PR is merged, delete the feature branch both locally and remotely.


### Example commands for the workflow:

```bash
# 1. Checkout a new feature branch from main
git checkout main  # Ensure you are on the main branch
git pull origin main  # Fetch latest changes from main
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature  # Create and switch to a new feature branch

# 2. Make a dummy commit (e.g., add a new file or change)
echo "Some feature work" > feature.txt  # Add a new file or make a change
git add feature.txt  # Stage the file for commit
git commit -m "Add feature.txt - dummy commit"  # Commit the changes

# 3. Bump the version and automatically tag the release
# (Bumpversion will handle both version bumping and tagging)
bumpversion patch  # Bumps version, e.g., from v0.1.0 to v0.1.1 (adjust based on version part you want)

# 4. Push the changes to remote (feature branch and the tag)
git push origin feature/my-new-feature  # Push the feature branch
git push origin --tags  # Push the new tag(s) created by bumpversion

# 5. Open a pull request from the feature branch to the main branch
# This can be done via GitHub UI, or using GitHub CLI
gh pr create \
  --base main \
  --head feature/my-new-feature \
  --title "pr_title" \
  --body "pr_body"

# 6.
gh pr list  # -> shows PRs and their IDs
gh pr view <id>

gh pr merge <id> --merge --delete-branch

# 7. After the PR is accepted and merged, delete the feature branch locally and remotely
git checkout main  # Switch back to main branch
git pull origin main  # Ensure your main branch is up-to-date
git branch -d feature/my-new-feature  # Delete the local feature branch
git push origin --delete feature/my-new-feature  # Delete the remote feature branch

```

## Notes

#### New(er) Build System with `pyproject.toml` and `setup.cfg`

Historically, packaging in Python was governed by standards such as `PEP-426`, `PEP-517`, and `PEP-518`. These PEPs introduced various mechanisms for packaging and building Python projects, but with certain limitations, especially regarding flexibility and future-proofing.

- **PEP-426**: Introduced the `setup.cfg` and `setup.py` files as the standard way to define package metadata and build configuration.
- **PEP-517**: Introduced a standardized interface for building Python projects, separating the build process from the packaging process and allowing for more flexible build systems.
- **PEP-518**: Defined how `pyproject.toml` should be used to declare build dependencies and system requirements, allowing tools like `pip` to know which backend to use for the build process.

While these PEPs were important milestones, the latest changes to the packaging ecosystem make `pyproject.toml` the preferred way to configure projects going forward.

- **`pip`**:
  - Tested with `pip install . --use-feature=in-tree-build` for forward compatibility with `pip 21.3` and later.
  - While `setup.py` is technically optional, an empty `setup.py` is still kept for enabling editable installs (`pip install -e .`), as this requires such a file for now.
  - `wheel` is added as a build-system dependency to maintain compatibility with versions of `pip` that do not yet fully implement `PEP 517`.

- **Replacing `setup.cfg` and `setup.py` with `pyproject.toml`**:
  - In the modern packaging ecosystem, `pyproject.toml` is increasingly the standard for declaring build systems, dependencies, and metadata. This configuration file simplifies the process and eliminates the need for separate `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` files in many cases.

For further reading on the transition to `pyproject.toml` and the removal of `setup.py`/`setup.cfg`, see the following discussions:
- [PEP-426](https://peps.python.org/pep-0426/)
- [PEP-517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/)
- [PEP-518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/)
- [Discussion on Setup.cfg Deprecation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44878600/is-setup-cfg-deprecated)

#### Using GitHub CLI in Workflow Actions

Easily integrate GitHub CLI into workflows to perform repository tasks. See the [GitHub CLI in workflows documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/using-github-cli-in-workflows).

**Example: Create a pull request**

```yaml
- name: Create a pull request
  run: gh pr create --title "My pull request" --body "This is an amazing PR" --label bug
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```


## Common issues

### `bump2version` fails on git tag with exit status 128

- check a signing key is configured: `git config --global user.signingkey` (see below for generating a key)
- repo is a detached HEAD? check out a branch: `git checkout main`
- there are changes that need to be committed? `git commit -am "commit message"`
- tag already exists? `git tag` to list tags, `git tag -d <tag>` to delete a tag

### No gpg key for signing commits
- generate a key with `gpg --full-generate-key`
  - standard options for keys: "(9) ECC (sign and encrypt) *default*" -> Curve 25519 -> expiry 2 years: "2y" -> name/email
- list keys with `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG`
- set the key for signing commits with `git config --global user.signingkey <key-id>`
- enable signing commits with `git config --global commit.gpgsign true`
- set the key for signing tags with `git config --global tag.gpgSign true`
- export the public key with `gpg --armor --export <key-id>`
  - and add it to your GitHub account: select 'New key' -> paste output of command above

Which one is the key id you might ask?
```
/home/$USER/.gnupg/secring.gpg
------------------------------
sec   4096R/<KEY_ID> 2024-11-22 [expires: 2025-11-22]
      uid                          Your Name <youremail@example.com>
ssb   4096R/<KEY_SUBKEY_ID> 2024-11-22

```

### GPG hangs/errors and never asks for passphrase of key?

- try: `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)`
