# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Requirements, General behavior
#
# REQ 0001: piwiPre is configured with HOME/.piwiPre.ini and piwiPre.ini files found in the hierarchy of directories
# REQ 0002: piwiPre is also configured by cmdline arguments
# REQ 0003: piwiPre renames .jpg, .mp4, .txt files found in 'triage' (enable-rename) (program_24)
# REQ 0004: piwiPre inserts metadata in .jpg and .mp4 files (enable-metadata)
# REQ 0005: piwiPre generates piwigo metadata (enable-thumbnails)
# REQ 0006: piwiPre synchronizes piwigo albums that were modified (enable-database)
# REQ 0007: piwiPre runs on windows and Linux development stations
# REQ 0008:  --dump-config folder allows to debug the configuration hierarchy (program_2)

# REQ 0009: piwiPre configures automatically album by ADDING piwiPre.ini files (autoconfiguration) (program_6, 7, 8, 9)
# REQ 0010: hand-writing a piwiPre.ini in albums may prevent any modification of files
# REQ 0011: during renaming, the name of .txt files is not changed. They simply go to the appropriate folder
# REQ 0012: tox is run on gitlab, generates html doc and coverage

# REQ 0020: 'enable-XXX' : false: feature is never active
# REQ 0021: 'enable-XXX' : true: feature is done in TRIAGE, and in ALBUMS if the result is not present


# REQ 0049: requirements are parsed from the source and put automatically in doc

# REQ 0050: temporary files are put in a real temporary dir
# REQ 0051: parser: remove trailing / at end of directories, this is common error

# REQ 0100: Renaming is based on the 'names' configuration template
# REQ 0101: Renaming takes into account the date/time of the picture shooting, found in metadata
# REQ 0102: if renaming a file clobber an existing file, piwiPre increments the last numerical field to avoid conflict
# REQ 0103: Configuration is stored in a hierarchy of .ini files
# REQ 0104: The root is $(HOME)/.piwiPre.ini
# REQ 0105: Others are dir/piwiPre.ini
# REQ 0106: *None* denotes a value which is not set. The previous value in the ini file hierarchy is inherited.

# REQ 0200: piwiPre verifies the albums are aligned with configuration (verify-album)
# REQ 0201: piwiPre realigns pictures rotation
# REQ 0202: piwiPre updates metadata
# REQ 0203: piwiPre generates lacking thumbnails from album

# REQ 0205: piwiPre removes useless thumbnails
# REQ 0206: the album to verify is specified by 'verify-album'
# REQ 0207: insert the 'author' metadata
# REQ 0208: use XMP metadata
# REQ 0209: --verify-album on all subdirectories when -- is set, which is not the default
# REQ 0210: (BUG) if --enable-metadata false, thumbnails have no metadata, IPTCinfo.save() raises an exception  # noqa
# REQ 0211: (BUG) picture 1994-05-Avril-05-Thorigne-010.jpg, date should be found                               # noqa
#

# REQ 0212 :  enable-date-in-filename true/false
#   DOC:
#       If there is a date in the filename, (according to the 'names' argument), then this date is used for metadata
#       Else, if there is a date in metadata, this one is kept
#       Else, the file creation time is used, and written in metadata
#       So, if a file is checked twice, the 2nd run does not perform any change
#
# REQ 0213: --auto-config sets the directory where piwiPre.ini is read recursively: REJECTED

# REQ 0214: during verify-album, if the picture has been changed since last metadata update,
#    or if metadata in db and file are different, then the information in database is reset,
#    and md5 computed again

# REQ 0215: if --enable-metadata-reset true (default : false), metadata is reset to output of current configuration

# REQ 0229: special syntax verify-album "*" verifies all the sub albums of the root
# REQ 0230: --enable-conversion
# REQ 0231: BUG: the Android app Piwigo NG hangs while playing video, while browsers play video OK on linux/windows
#           this bug is solved when using piwigo 15.2.0, without any modification of piwiPre
# REQ 0232:  --language [en, fr], chosen by default with the locale
# REQ 0233: doc in FRENCH
# REQ 0234: --enable-pwg-representative

# REQ 0237: --language sets the default value of names and instructions
# REQ 0238: --auto-install
# REQ 0239: --piwiPre-path dir
# REQ 0240: logfile is written in CWD, but if the directory is not writable, writes in HOME
#           (before management of --home and --base)
#           this resolves a disaster when started from ProgramFiles


# REQ 0250: pwpInstaller installes piwiPre, Installer, Configurator, its environment, ffmpeg/ffprobe and MariaDb-CC
# REQ 0251: pwpInstaller builds the shortcuts for GUIs in user application menu
# REQ 0252: pwpInstaller starts in --base or HOME/Downloads
# REQ 0253: pwpInstaller adds environ['PROGRAMFILES(X86)']/piwiPre to the PATH      # noqa

# REQ 0270: piwiPre saves the latest starting dir in HOME/.piwiPre.last.hostname
# REQ 0271: piwiPre GUI is started in --base or HOME/.piwiPre.last or HOME
# REQ 0272: piwiPre reads,displays,modifies,reset piwiPre.ini from --base, or changes dir

# REQ 0300: piwiPre maintains (in album context) the database structure
# REQ 0301: piwiPre creates (in triage context) the database structure
# REQ 0302: piwiPre uses MD5 checksum to compare local and remote files
# REQ 0303: Compute MD5 checksums and add them directly in the database when doing a synchro
# REQ 0304: piwiPre reorders the piwigo directories with the right order !  (future piwiPre version 2.0)

# REQ 0306: generate an error if HOME/.piwiPre.ini is not protected: CANCELLED, because chmod is limited in windows
# REQ 0307: clean useless directories in THUMBNAILS (useless files are removed while doing verify-album)
# REQ 0308: installer that allows to download piwiPre, ffmpeg and mariaDb
# REQ 0309: graphical UI for installer
# REQ 0310: REJECTED: The installer should propose a simplified view depending on use cases

# TODO REQ 0311 : installer: Check if MariaDB is installed before installing it
#    This seems non trivial: piwiPre works, for the python and exe version, without installing mariaDB
#         This has been tested on a PC that has no reasons to have mariaDB CC installed
#         That being said, maybe some program has installed maria DB...
#    The only reference to MariaDB in the registry is
#         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\MariaDB Corporation\MariaDB Connector C
#    There is no MariaDB directory in "C:\Program Files (x86)" or "C:\Program Files"
#          or "C:\Users\fabien-local\AppData\Local"
#    Hypothesis: MariaDB CC is required on SOME database connections, not all.
#    Conservative solution: installer still allows to install MariaDB CC, just in case

# DONE: test enable-auto-configuration program 36, 37, 38, 436, 437
# REQ 0312: REJECTED if HOME or BASE not configured, MUST Configure it before configuring other directory
# REQ 0313: string editor: manage the length of fields
# REQ 0314: default value for BASE is HOME/Pictures/BASE, in the installer
# REQ 0315: It is possible to change HOME through the Configurator UI, even if this is NOT recommended
# REQ 0316: PiwiPre configurator, [Write Config] is disabled unless the config has changed OR .lnk is lacking
# REQ 0317: BUG: executing program_33, the directory BACKUP is not filled with modified pictures
# REQ 0318: build downloads.rst with the versions that are really available on the server
# REQ 0319:  in PwpInstaller, the action buttons are not green until the async actions are done
# REQ 0320: explain how to manage COMODO
# REQ 0321: installer uses also the date to stamp piwiPre.exe in the Programs directory, like pwpInstaller
# REQ 0322: backup-ed files are writen in BACKUP/time-stamp/
# REQ 0323: in TRIAGE stage, ALL files are backup, this allows to empty TRIAGE from files that have been processed
# REQ 0324: BUG: The tmp directories created by tests are not removed
# REQ 0325: BUG: When tmp thumbnails directory is removed and then isdir(), errno 13 is raised. # noqa
# REQ 0326: Potential race condition. (Solved)
#      Very seldom, while executing program_0, we can see 8 ignored exception in program_908:
#      Tk: main thread not in main loop
#      There are 8 windows in program_908.
#      Hypothesis: a race condition between end of program and end of TkThread ?
# REQ 0326: one option of pwpInstaller is to install ONLY the new installer, and can launch it afterwards
#      Therefore, piwiPre is started with the installer aligned with it.
# REQ 0327: GUI: When config is writen in BASE, HOME etc, the 'configured Y/N' status of the directory is updated
# REQ 0328: pwpInstaller downloads & extracts HTML Help in piwiPre directory
# REQ 0329: when a config is modified by the UI, the inherited value SHOULD NOT be writen in the config file
# REQ 0330: when a config is modified by the UI, the relatives paths to BASE should be kept relative. e.g. triage
# REQ 0331: Create subdir in DirChooser does NOT select this dir, only make it
# REQ 0332: When BASE is configured, Configure subdir button is enabled
# REQ 0333: LOGGER has a gui component, with alert popups for warnings and errors
# REQ 0334: Errors in config files are not fatal when there is a GUI
# REQ 0335: When --enable-create-base true, also create TRIAGE
# TODO REQ 0336: When there is a bug in HOME/.piwiPre.ini, clearly explain where the bug is, and allow to change it
# REQ 0337: 'Save config' also writes HOME/.piwiPre.last.{current_host}
# REQ 0338: 'Save config' adds one item in the history of used BASE, pwpGui displays a menu to choose among them
# TODO REQ 0339: the GUI should be shorter on shorter screens, so that the messages windows is always visible
# REQ 0340: CANCELLED after 'save config', the GUI goes directly to the minimal mode, 'Cancel Params' is useless
# REQ 0341: in the minimal GUI mode, there is a warning if BASE is not configured, and Execute is disabled.
# REQ 0342: Change "Undo/Inherit/Modify' into 'File/Inherit/Modify file value'
# REQ 0343: the green of 'Origins" is lighter
# REQ 0344: if the origin is BASE or HOME, display origin = BASE or HOME, not the filename
# REQ 0345: Cancel Param is replaced by Change Parameters  Yes/No
# REQ 0346: "Create local shortcuts" is hidden when "Cancel Params" is used
# REQ 0347: HOME cannot be changed from the GUI
# TODO REQ 0348: Add a way to remove BASEs from the base history
# REQ 0349: is piwiPre is started with a BASE, it is added at the top of the base history
# REQ 0350: It is always possible to save the config, maybe we want it to be exactly the defaults.
# REQ 0351: if HOME is not configured, it nevertheless appears in the list of directories to configure
# REQ 0352: CANCELLED when "Modify directory" is entered, the buttons (Cancel Param, Config Home etc) are disabled
# REQ 0353: BUG restart-from-dir and base-last should not be seen from the GUI
# REQ 0354: NOT A BUG, a feature! if 'quiet' is modified in the GUI and config saved,
#           Origin is still gui , which is normal, because this value IS NOT saved in the config file
# REQ 0355: BUG: Modify triage, save, inherit (origin = DEFAULT, ok), save : origin = BASE ! and nothing in the .ini
# REQ 0356: BUG: The GUI Should allow to edit HOME, BASE, SUBDIRS and then CMDLINE.     # noqa
# REQ 0357: BUG: DirChooser does not select correctly directories
# REQ 0358: BUG: in case of error (e.g. verify album abnormal) the spinner continues to spin
# REQ 0359: SPEC Change !!! argument of --verify-album starts from BASE not from ALBUM, otherwise GUI incoherent
# REQ 0360: for the sake of clarity, change 'base' into 'occasion' inside NAMES
# REQ 0361: internally, all paths are linux (/) and relative to BASE or absolute
# REQ 0362: SPEC CHANGE !!! ALBUM configuration is put in AUTO-CONFIG, not in THUMBNAILS
#           because, in simpler cases, there is NO THUMBNAILS
#           and a separate dir allows to mount it
# REQ 0363: SPEC CHANGE !!! recursive-verify-album --> enable-verify-sub-album
# REQ 0364: Add a GUI item = nb of files processed
# TODO REQ 0365: when there is an erroneous flag, remove it from args after warning, otherwise warning several times
# REQ 0366: Change BASE allows to create and configure a new one
# REQ 0367: Cancel params resets values to default and dir to configure to BASE
# REQ 0368: BUG: wrong BASE sur dirs in the config hierarchy
# REQ 0369: nb of piwiPre-last.bak is limited to 5
# REQ 0370: pwg_representative SHOULD NOT be inserted in the DB. see program_610
# REQ 0371: (Corrected) BUG: 0323 is not completely implemented, in program_39 stage_1, TRIAGE is not Empty !
# REQ 0372: --piwigo-groups-enabled is a list of groups, that can access to new pictures/folders added
# REQ 0373: Newly inserted albums MUST have a representative_picture, which will be set to the 1st picture
# REQ 0374: [REJECTED] verify-album verifies that pwg_representative access_list is empty
# REQ 0375: verify-album verifies that each directory has a representative picture
# REQ 0376: Perform a test with hierarchy = BASE/TRIAGE/dir/subdir/photos and BASE/ALBUM/dir/subdir/photos
# REQ 0377: in TRIAGE mode, cleaning the thumbnails must preserve the ones coming from previous images in ALBUM
# REQ 0378: a dir with no pictures but sub-dir, pict representative is chosen among sons, see program_602
# REQ 0379: Spec change: --enable-rename prevents file collision, provided --enable-conflict-resolution  see program_42
# REQ 0380: Spec Change: auto-config takes into account all config elements (writable in a config file) in the dir
# REQ 0381: Spec Change: cmdline arguments have ALWAYS precedence over others, including auto-config arguments
# REQ 0382: BUG: piwiPre tries to "guess" the server constraint for album and thumbnails.
#           As a consequence, some config parameters are modified,
#           and the user cannot execute immediately piwiPre
#     Solution:
#           Do NOT guess the settings, just initialize to ALL, which means unknown.
#           So that the config items are modified only when the server menu is used.
# REQ 0383: If a constraints requires a value, look also at the previous value to inherit from it
#           rather than using the default value
# REQ 0384: clean remote-auto-config in tests framework (program 499)
# REQ 0385: Keep only the last 4 packages, in Program files.
# REQ 0386: Keep only the last 4 packages, on gitlab (if >=20, the last one is not seen!)
# REQ 0387: BUG: even if Installer is installed, the GUI shows "install", not reinstall
# REQ 0388: 'Change BASE' should change if completely, even after 'cancel params'
# REQ 0389: BUG: when a file is already in ALBUM, it is NOT erased from TRIAGE
# REQ 0390: BUG: the detection of last pwpInstaller is broken, since pwpInstaller.exe does not exist anymore
# REQ 0391: After modifications of the database, purge the cache of all users
# REQ 0392: during verify-album, extra AUTO-CONFIG files are removed
# REQ 0393: SPEC CHANGE: by default, auto-config is ALBUM/pwg_representative/AUTO-CONFIG
#           so that it is kept with ALBUM more easily
# REQ 0394: SPEC CHANGE: introduce enable-rename-verifying
# TODO REQ 0395: minor SPEC CHANGE: actual cmdline arguments are used for GUI CMDLINE
#          This requires an investigation:
#          - it is not obvious that we need that : in any case, we CAN modify the values with the CMDLINE GUI.
#          - it may introduce complexities in the code
#          - it may introduce strange side effects
# REQ 0396: verify-album should support png in the album (see program_211)
# REQ 0397: Even if -enable-rename-verifying IS false, if enable-conversion is true, we can change the extension to jpg
# REQ 0398: Remove enable-database and enable-thumbnails from the auto-config parameters, so 2 steps can work
# REQ 0399: restart-from-dir manages {album} and can be a subdir at several level from the album being verified
# REQ 0400: manage mp3 and audio formats handled by ffmpeg see program_50 & program_211
# REQ 0401: piwiPre verifies also that the representative picture of directories is a valid file
# REQ 0402: .JPG pictures are allowed in album, in addition to .jpg
# REQ 0403: Put a 'video' logo on pwg_representative pictures
# REQ 0404: Verify that all pwg_representative have a corresponding video
# REQ 0405: GUI ask Y/N to confirm creation of new directory
# REQ 0406: when executing piwiPre, the GUI "execute" button is disabled.
# REQ 0407: BUG in triage mode, if Year/Date dir is created, Date as a representative, but Year not.
# REQ 0408: if a file is duplicated in ALBUM, it SHOULD be erased by verify-album when enable-rename-verifying is True
# REQ 0409: during verify-album, .JPG are moved to .jpg
# REQ 0410: DirChooser displays TRIAGE, ALBUM when it makes sense
# FIXME DOC: .authorized keys (ssh doc) login is the local ones, i.e. on the PC, not the server
