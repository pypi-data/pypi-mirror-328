        description: "Guralp short-period OBS 3-component accelerometer, with a flat frequency response between 0.1 Hz and 100 Hz and sensitivity of about 5 V/m/s2. The hydrophone has a flat frequency response between 2Hz and 30 kHz, with a sensitivity of -165dB re: 1V uPa (562V/Bar). The digitiser can record four primary input channels at sample rates of up to 1000 sps."
