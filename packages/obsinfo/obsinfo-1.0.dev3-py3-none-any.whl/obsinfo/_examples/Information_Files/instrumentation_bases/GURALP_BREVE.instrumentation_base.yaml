        description: "Guralp 3-component accelerometer, with a flat frequency response between 0.1 Hz and 100 Hz. The hydrophone has a flat frequency response between 2Hz and 30 kHz, with a sensitivity of -165dB re: 1V uPa (562V/Bar). The digitiser can record four primary input channels at sample rates of up to 1000 sps."

notes: ["Using the FORCE string ('replace_') for the H sensor avoids it inheriting information from the default sensor"]
