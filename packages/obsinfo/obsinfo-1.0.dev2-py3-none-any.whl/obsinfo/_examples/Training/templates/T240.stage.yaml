   # if delay is specified, it will go directly into StationXML without modification
   # if not specified and this is a digital stage, delay is calculated as filter offset / input_sample_rate

   # polarity is specified when the stage inverts polarity, usually in a sensor. 
   # In a seismometer, upward movement usually means positive voltage by default. 
   # In a hydrophone, positive pressure usually means positive voltage by default. 
   # If it's the contrary, must invert polarity (put a minus). 
   # Some dataloggers invert polarity too.
   polarity: "+"
