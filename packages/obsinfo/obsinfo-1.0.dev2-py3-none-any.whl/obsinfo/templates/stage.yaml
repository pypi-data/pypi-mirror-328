   delay: 
   # polarity is specified when the stage inverts polarity, usually in a sensor. 
   # In a seismometer, upward movement usually means positive voltage by default. 
   # In a hydrophone, positive pressure usually means positive voltage by default. 
   # If it's the contrary, must invert polarity (put a minus). 
   # Some dataloggers invert polarity too.
   polarity: # "+" or "-"
