Vector field building
--------------------

The function :func:`dyntrack.tl.vector_field` uses
`vfkm <https://github.com/nivan/vfkm/>`__ to generate vector fields (see
`license <https://github.com/LouisFaure/dyntrack/blob/main/vfkm/LICENSE>`__),

FTLE scalar field generation
---------------------------

Code from :func:`dyntrack.tl.FTLE` have been adapted and optimized from `Richard
Galvez's
notebook <https://github.com/richardagalvez/Vortices-Python/blob/master/Vortex-FTLE.ipynb>`__


Principal tree fitting with SimplePPT
------------------------------------

Code from :func:`dyntrack.tl.fit_ppt` uses SimplePPT algorithm to fit principal trees on each frames.
SimplePPT has been described in the following paper::
