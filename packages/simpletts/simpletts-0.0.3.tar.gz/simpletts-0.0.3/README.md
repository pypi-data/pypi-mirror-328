# SimpleTTS

A lightweight Python library for running TTS models with a unified API.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is under active development and APIs may change. Not recommended for production use yet.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Simple and intuitive API - get started with two lines of code using the simple API
- ðŸ”„ No model lock-in - switch models with just a few lines of code
- ðŸŽ¯ Focus on ease of use - a single API for all models
- ðŸ“¦ Minimal dependencies - one package for all models
- ðŸ”Œ Extensible architecture - easily add new models
- ðŸ’Ž Feature-rich - includes longform narration, voice cloning support, and more

## Models

- XTTS
- Kokoro (v1.0)
- F5-TTS
- [& more](https://fakerybakery.github.io/simpletts/models/)

## Installation

Install the latest release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install simpletts
```

## Quick Start (Simple API)

If you don't plan on choosing a custom model or using voice cloning, you can use the simple API. Currently, the simple API uses the Kokoro model.

```python
from simpletts import tts

tts("Hello, world!").save("output.wav")
```

View the [Simple API docs](https://fakerybakery.github.io/simpletts/simple/) for more information.

## Python API

**Get started with the XTTS model:**

```python
import soundfile as sf
from simpletts.models.xtts import XTTS

tts = XTTS(device="auto")
# Easily swap out for F5-TTS:
# from simpletts.models.f5 import F5TTS
# tts = F5TTS(device="auto")

array, sr = tts.synthesize("Hello, world!", ref="sample.wav")

sf.write("output.wav", array, sr)
```

Please see the [docs](https://fakerybakery.github.io/simpletts/) for more information, such as available models, code examples, and more.
