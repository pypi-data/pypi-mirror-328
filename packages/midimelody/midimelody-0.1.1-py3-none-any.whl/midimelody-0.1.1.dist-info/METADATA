# Musical MIDI Generator

A Python-based MIDI melody generator that creates musical compositions across different genres with sophisticated chord progressions, melodic patterns, and basslines.

## Features

- Multiple genre support including:
  - Pop/Rock
  - Jazz
  - Blues
  - Latin
  - Folk/Acoustic
  - Electronic
  - Epic/Film Score
  - R&B/Soul
- Intelligent chord progression generation based on genre
- Dynamic melody creation with genre-specific patterns
- Accompanying bassline generation
- Support for different musical keys
- Multi-track MIDI output (melody, chords, and bass)
- Genre-appropriate rhythmic patterns
- Verse and chorus section generation

## Installation

You can install this package in two ways:

### 1. Using pip (Recommended)
```bash
pip install --index-url https://maven.pkg.github.com/JDCurry/midi-melody-generator/ midimelody
```

### 2. From source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JDCurry/midi-melody-generator.git
cd midi-melody-generator
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### As a Python Package
```python
from midimelody import generate_midi

# Generate a new MIDI composition
generate_midi()
```

### From Command Line
If installed from source, you can run directly:
```bash
python melody_generator.py
```

Follow the interactive prompts to:
1. Select a musical key (C, C#/Db, D, etc.)
2. Choose a genre
3. The program will generate a MIDI file with a unique name in your current directory

## How It Works

The generator creates music in three layers:

1. **Chord Progression**: Genre-specific chord progressions that form the harmonic foundation
2. **Melody**: Intelligent melody generation that follows chord tones and scale degrees
3. **Bassline**: Complementary bass patterns that match the genre and harmony

Each genre has its own characteristics:
- Pop/Rock: Standard chord progressions with catchy melodic patterns
- Jazz: Sophisticated harmony with extended chords
- Blues: Traditional 12-bar patterns with blue notes
- Latin: Syncopated rhythms and specific harmonic movements
- Folk: Simple, traditional progressions
- Electronic: Modern, repetitive patterns
- Epic/Film Score: Dramatic progressions and wide melodic ranges
- R&B/Soul: Soulful progressions with rhythmic emphasis

## Development

### Setting up for development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JDCurry/midi-melody-generator.git
cd midi-melody-generator
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install development dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running Tests
```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_generator.py
```
