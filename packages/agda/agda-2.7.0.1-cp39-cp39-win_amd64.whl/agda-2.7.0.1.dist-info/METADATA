# Agda Python Distribution

A project that packages Agda as a Python package, which allows you to install Agda from PyPI:

```bash
pip install agda
```

The PyPI package versions follow the [PvP] version numbers of Agda releases, with post-release versions (_e.g._, `v2.6.3.post1`) for patches and non-breaking changes to the documentation and packaging.

Binary wheels are provided for the following platforms:

| Platform | Release    | Architecture |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| macOS    | ≥10.10     | x86_64       |
|          | ≥13.0      | ARM64        |
| Linux    | libc ≥2.17 | x86_64       |
|          | libc ≥2.28 | aarch64      |
|          | musl ≥1.1  | x86_64       |
| Windows  |            | AMD64        |

The availability of binary wheels is largely determined by the availability of GHC binaries.
