For example,\nstarting a workflow with an `int` parameter when it accepts a `str` parameter would cause MyPy to fail.\n\n**Different Activity Types**\n\nThe activity worker has been developed to work with `async def`, threaded, and multiprocess activities. While\n`async def` activities are the easiest and recommended, care has been taken to make heartbeating and cancellation also\nwork across threads/processes.\n\n**Custom `asyncio` Event Loop**\n\nThe workflow implementation basically turns `async def` functions into workflows backed by a distributed, fault-tolerant\nevent loop. This means task management, sleep, cancellation, etc have all been developed to seamlessly integrate with\n`asyncio` concepts.\n\nSee the [blog post](https://temporal.io/blog/durable-distributed-asyncio-event-loop) introducing the Python SDK for an\ninformal introduction to the features and their implementation.\n\n---\n\n<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n<!-- DON\'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->\n**Contents**\n\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n  - [Installation](#installation)\n  - [Implementing a Workflow](#implementing-a-workflow)\n  - [Running a Workflow](#running-a-workflow)\n  - [Next Steps](#next-steps)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n    - [Client](#client)\n      - [Data Conversion](#data-conversion)\n        - [Pydantic Support](#pydantic-support)\n        - [Custom Type Data Conversion](#custom-type-data-conversion)\n    - [Workers](#workers)\n    - [Workflows](#workflows)\n      - [Definition](#definition)\n      - [Running](#running)\n      - [Invoking Activities](#invoking-activities)\n      - [Invoking Child Workflows](#invoking-child-workflows)\n      - [Timers](#timers)\n      - [Conditions](#conditions)\n      - [Asyncio and Determinism](#asyncio-and-determinism)\n      - [Asyncio Cancellation](#asyncio-cancellation)\n      - [Workflow Utilities](#workflow-utilities)\n      - [Exceptions](#exceptions)\n      - [Signal and update handlers](#signal-and-update-handlers)\n      - [External Workflows](#external-workflows)\n      - [Testing](#testing)\n        - [Automatic Time Skipping](#automatic-time-skipping)\n        - [Manual Time Skipping](#manual-time-skipping)\n        - [Mocking Activities](#mocking-activities)\n      - [Workflow Sandbox](#workflow-sandbox)\n        - [How the Sandbox Works](#how-the-sandbox-works)\n        - [Avoiding the Sandbox](#avoiding-the-sandbox)\n        - [Customizing the Sandbox](#customizing-the-sandbox)\n          - [Passthrough Modules](#passthrough-modules)\n          - [Invalid Module Members](#invalid-module-members)\n        - [Known Sandbox Issues](#known-sandbox-issues)\n          - [Global Import/Builtins](#global-importbuiltins)\n          - [Sandbox is not Secure](#sandbox-is-not-secure)\n          - [Sandbox Performance](#sandbox-performance)\n          - [Extending Restricted Classes](#extending-restricted-classes)\n          - [Certain Standard Library Calls on Restricted Objects](#certain-standard-library-calls-on-restricted-objects)\n          - [is_subclass of ABC-based Restricted Classes](#is_subclass-of-abc-based-restricted-classes)\n    - [Activities](#activities)\n      - [Definition](#definition-1)\n      - [Types of Activities](#types-of-activities)\n        - [Synchronous Activities](#synchronous-activities)\n          - [Synchronous Multithreaded Activities](#synchronous-multithreaded-activities)\n          - [Synchronous Multiprocess/Other Activities](#synchronous-multiprocessother-activities)\n        - [Asynchronous Activities](#asynchronous-activities)\n      - [Activity Context](#activity-context)\n        - [Heartbeating and Cancellation](#heartbeating-and-cancellation)\n        - [Worker Shutdown](#worker-shutdown)\n      - [Testing](#testing-1)\n    - [Workflow Replay](#workflow-replay)\n    - [OpenTelemetry Support](#opentelemetry-support)\n    - [Protobuf 3.x vs 4.x](#protobuf-3x-vs-4x)\n    - [Known Compatibility Issues](#known-compatibility-issues)\n      - [gevent Patching](#gevent-patching)\n- [Development](#development)\n    - [Building](#building)\n      - [Prepare](#prepare)\n      - [Build](#build)\n      - [Use](#use)\n    - [Local SDK development environment](#local-sdk-development-environment)\n      - [Testing](#testing-2)\n      - [Proto Generation and Testing](#proto-generation-and-testing)\n    - [Style](#style)\n\n<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\n\n# Quick Start\n\nWe will guide you through the Temporal basics to create a "hello, world!" script on your machine. It is not intended as\none of the ways to use Temporal, but in reality it is very simplified and decidedly not "the only way" to use Temporal.\nFor more information, check out the docs references in "Next Steps" below the quick start.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall the `temporalio` package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/temporalio).\n\nThese steps can be followed to use with a virtual environment and `pip`:\n\n* [Create a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments)\n* Update `pip` - `python -m pip install -U pip`\n  * Needed because older versions of `pip` may not pick the right wheel\n* Install Temporal SDK - `python -m pip install temporalio`\n\nThe SDK is now ready for use. To build from source, see "Building" near the end of this documentation.\n\n**NOTE: This README is for the current branch and not necessarily what\'s released on `PyPI`.**\n\n## Implementing a Workflow\n\nCreate the following in `activities.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom temporalio import activity\n\n@activity.defn\ndef say_hello(name: str) -> str:\n    return f"Hello, {name}!"\n```\n\nCreate the following in `workflows.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import timedelta\nfrom temporalio import workflow\n\n# Import our activity, passing it through the sandbox\nwith workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through():\n    from .activities import say_hello\n\n@workflow.defn\nclass SayHello:\n    @workflow.run\n    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:\n        return await workflow.execute_activity(\n            say_hello, name, schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5)\n        )\n```\n\nCreate the following in `run_worker.py`:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport concurrent.futures\nfrom temporalio.client import Client\nfrom temporalio.worker import Worker\n\n# Import the activity and workflow from our other files\nfrom .activities import say_hello\nfrom .workflows import SayHello\n\nasync def main():\n    # Create client connected to server at the given address\n    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")\n\n    # Run the worker\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=100) as activity_executor:\n        worker = Worker(\n          client,\n          task_queue="my-task-queue",\n          workflows=[SayHello],\n          activities=[say_hello],\n          activity_executor=activity_executor,\n        )\n        await worker.run()\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nAssuming you have a [Temporal server running on localhost](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/server/quick-install/), this\nwill run the worker:\n\n    python run_worker.py\n\n## Running a Workflow\n\nCreate the following script at `run_workflow.py`:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom temporalio.client import Client\n\n# Import the workflow from the previous code\nfrom .workflows import SayHello\n\nasync def main():\n    # Create client connected to server at the given address\n    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")\n\n    # Execute a workflow\n    result = await client.execute_workflow(SayHello.run, "my name", id="my-workflow-id", task_queue="my-task-queue")\n\n    print(f"Result: {result}")\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nAssuming you have `run_worker.py` running from before, this will run the workflow:\n\n    python run_workflow.py\n\nThe output will be:\n\n    Result: Hello, my-name!\n\n## Next Steps\n\nTemporal can be implemented in your code in many different ways, to suit your application\'s needs. The links below will\ngive you much more information about how Temporal works with Python:\n\n* [Code Samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python) - If you want to start with some code, we have provided\n  some pre-built samples.\n* [Application Development Guide](https://docs.temporal.io/application-development?lang=python) Our Python specific\n  Developer\'s Guide will give you much more information on how to build with Temporal in your Python applications than\n  our SDK README ever could (or should).\n* [API Documentation](https://python.temporal.io) - Full Temporal Python SDK package documentation.\n\n---\n\n# Usage\n\nFrom here, you will find reference documentation about specific pieces of the Temporal Python SDK that were built around\nTemporal concepts. *This section is not intended as a how-to guide* -- For more how-to oriented information, check out\nthe links in the [Next Steps](#next-steps) section above.\n\n### Client\n\nA client can be created and used to start a workflow like so:\n\n```python\nfrom temporalio.client import Client\n\nasync def main():\n    # Create client connected to server at the given address and namespace\n    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233", namespace="my-namespace")\n\n    # Start a workflow\n    handle = await client.start_workflow(MyWorkflow.run, "some arg", id="my-workflow-id", task_queue="my-task-queue")\n\n    # Wait for result\n    result = await handle.result()\n    print(f"Result: {result}")\n```\n\nSome things to note about the above code:\n\n* A `Client` does not have an explicit "close"\n* To enable TLS, the `tls` argument to `connect` can be set to `True` or a `TLSConfig` object\n* A single positional argument can be passed to `start_workflow`. If there are multiple arguments, only the\n  non-type-safe form of `start_workflow` can be used (i.e. the one accepting a string workflow name) and it must be in\n  the `args` keyword argument.\n* The `handle` represents the workflow that was started and can be used for more than just getting the result\n* Since we are just getting the handle and waiting on the result, we could have called `client.execute_workflow` which\n  does the same thing\n* Clients can have many more options not shown here (e.g. data converters and interceptors)\n* A string can be used instead of the method reference to call a workflow by name (e.g. if defined in another language)\n* Clients do not work across forks\n\nClients also provide a shallow copy of their config for use in making slightly different clients backed by the same\nconnection. For instance, given the `client` above, this is how to have a client in another namespace:\n\n```python\nconfig = client.config()\nconfig["namespace"] = "my-other-namespace"\nother_ns_client = Client(**config)\n```\n\n#### Data Conversion\n\nData converters are used to convert raw Temporal payloads to/from actual Python types. A custom data converter of type\n`temporalio.converter.DataConverter` can be set via the `data_converter` parameter of the `Client` constructor. Data\nconverters are a combination of payload converters, payload codecs, and failure converters. Payload converters convert\nPython values to/from serialized bytes. Payload codecs convert bytes to bytes (e.g. for compression or encryption).\nFailure converters convert exceptions to/from serialized failures.\n\nThe default data converter supports converting multiple types including:\n\n* `None`\n* `bytes`\n* `google.protobuf.message.Message` - As JSON when encoding, but has ability to decode binary proto from other languages\n* Anything that can be converted to JSON including:\n  * Anything that [`json.dump`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dump) supports natively\n  * [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)\n  * Iterables including ones JSON dump may not support by default, e.g. `set`\n  * [IntEnum, StrEnum](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html) based enumerates\n  * [UUID](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html)\n\nTo use pydantic model instances, see [](#pydantic-support).\n\n`datetime.date`, `datetime.time`, and `datetime.datetime` can only be used with the Pydantic data converter.\n\nAlthough workflows, updates, signals, and queries can all be defined with multiple input parameters, users are strongly\nencouraged to use a single `dataclass` or Pydantic model parameter, so that fields with defaults can be easily added\nwithout breaking compatibility. Similar advice applies to return values.\n\nClasses with generics may not have the generics properly resolved. The current implementation does not have generic\ntype resolution. Users should use concrete types.\n\n##### Pydantic Support\n\nTo use Pydantic model instances, install Pydantic and set the Pydantic data converter when creating client instances:\n\n```python\nfrom temporalio.contrib.pydantic import pydantic_data_converter\n\nclient = Client(data_converter=pydantic_data_converter, ...)\n```\n\nThis data converter supports conversion of all types supported by Pydantic to and from JSON.\n\nIn addition to Pydantic models, these include all `json.dump`-able types, various non-`json.dump`-able standard library\ntypes such as dataclasses, types from the datetime module, sets, UUID, etc, and custom types composed of any of these.\n\nPydantic v1 is not supported by this data converter. If you are not yet able to upgrade from Pydantic v1, see\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/tree/main/pydantic_converter/v1 for limited v1 support.\n\n\n##### Custom Type Data Conversion\n\nFor converting from JSON, the workflow/activity type hint is taken into account to convert to the proper type. Care has\nbeen taken to support all common typings including `Optional`, `Union`, all forms of iterables and mappings, `NewType`,\netc in addition to the regular JSON values mentioned before.\n\nData converters contain a reference to a payload converter class that is used to convert to/from payloads/values. This\nis a class and not an instance because it is instantiated on every workflow run inside the sandbox. The payload\nconverter is usually a `CompositePayloadConverter` which contains a multiple `EncodingPayloadConverter`s it uses to try\nto serialize/deserialize payloads. Upon serialization, each `EncodingPayloadConverter` is tried until one succeeds. The\n`EncodingPayloadConverter` provides an "encoding" string serialized onto the payload so that, upon deserialization, the\nspecific `EncodingPayloadConverter` for the given "encoding" is used.\n\nThe default data converter uses the `DefaultPayloadConverter` which is simply a `CompositePayloadConverter` with a known\nset of default `EncodingPayloadConverter`s. To implement a custom encoding for a custom type, a new\n`EncodingPayloadConverter` can be created for the new type. For example, to support `IPv4Address` types:\n\n```python\nclass IPv4AddressEncodingPayloadConverter(EncodingPayloadConverter):\n    @property\n    def encoding(self) -> str:\n        return "text/ipv4-address"\n\n    def to_payload(self, value: Any) -> Optional[Payload]:\n        if isinstance(value, ipaddress.IPv4Address):\n            return Payload(\n                metadata={"encoding": self.encoding.encode()},\n                data=str(value).encode(),\n            )\n        else:\n            return None\n\n    def from_payload(self, payload: Payload, type_hint: Optional[Type] = None) -> Any:\n        assert not type_hint or type_hint is ipaddress.IPv4Address\n        return ipaddress.IPv4Address(payload.data.decode())\n\nclass IPv4AddressPayloadConverter(CompositePayloadConverter):\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        # Just add ours as first before the defaults\n        super().__init__(\n            IPv4AddressEncodingPayloadConverter(),\n            *DefaultPayloadConverter.default_encoding_payload_converters,\n        )\n\nmy_data_converter = dataclasses.replace(\n    DataConverter.default,\n    payload_converter_class=IPv4AddressPayloadConverter,\n)\n```\n\nImports are left off for brevity.\n\nThis is good for many custom types. However, sometimes you want to override the behavior of the just the existing JSON\nencoding payload converter to support a new type. It is already the last encoding data converter in the list, so it\'s\nthe fall-through behavior for any otherwise unknown type. Customizing the existing JSON converter has the benefit of\nmaking the type work in lists, unions, etc.\n\nThe `JSONPlainPayloadConverter` uses the Python [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) library with an\nadvanced JSON encoder by default and a custom value conversion method to turn `json.load`ed values to their type hints.\nThe conversion can be customized for serialization with a custom `json.JSONEncoder` and deserialization with a custom\n`JSONTypeConverter`. For example, to support `IPv4Address` types in existing JSON conversion:\n\n```python\nclass IPv4AddressJSONEncoder(AdvancedJSONEncoder):\n    def default(self, o: Any) -> Any:\n        if isinstance(o, ipaddress.IPv4Address):\n            return str(o)\n        return super().default(o)\nclass IPv4AddressJSONTypeConverter(JSONTypeConverter):\n    def to_typed_value(\n        self, hint: Type, value: Any\n    ) -> Union[Optional[Any], _JSONTypeConverterUnhandled]:\n        if issubclass(hint, ipaddress.IPv4Address):\n            return ipaddress.IPv4Address(value)\n        return JSONTypeConverter.Unhandled\n\nclass IPv4AddressPayloadConverter(CompositePayloadConverter):\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        # Replace default JSON plain with our own that has our encoder and type\n        # converter\n        json_converter = JSONPlainPayloadConverter(\n            encoder=IPv4AddressJSONEncoder,\n            custom_type_converters=[IPv4AddressJSONTypeConverter()],\n        )\n        super().__init__(\n            *[\n                c if not isinstance(c, JSONPlainPayloadConverter) else json_converter\n                for c in DefaultPayloadConverter.default_encoding_payload_converters\n            ]\n        )\n\nmy_data_converter = dataclasses.replace(\n    DataConverter.default,\n    payload_converter_class=IPv4AddressPayloadConverter,\n)\n```\n\nNow `IPv4Address` can be used in type hints including collections, optionals, etc.\n\n### Workers\n\nWorkers host workflows and/or activities. Here\'s how to run a worker:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport logging\nfrom temporalio.client import Client\nfrom temporalio.worker import Worker\n# Import your own workflows and activities\nfrom my_workflow_package import MyWorkflow, my_activity\n\nasync def run_worker(stop_event: asyncio.Event):\n    # Create client connected to server at the given address\n    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233", namespace="my-namespace")\n\n    # Run the worker until the event is set\n    worker = Worker(client, task_queue="my-task-queue", workflows=[MyWorkflow], activities=[my_activity])\n    async with worker:\n        await stop_event.wait()\n```\n\nSome things to note about the above code:\n\n* This creates/uses the same client that is used for starting workflows\n* While this example accepts a stop event and uses `async with`, `run()` and `shutdown()` may be used instead\n* Workers can have many more options not shown here (e.g. data converters and interceptors)\n\n### Workflows\n\n#### Definition\n\nWorkflows are defined as classes decorated with `@workflow.defn`. The method invoked for the workflow is decorated with\n`@workflow.run`. Methods for signals, queries, and updates are decorated with `@workflow.signal`, `@workflow.query`\nand `@workflow.update` respectively. Here\'s an example of a workflow:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom datetime import timedelta\nfrom temporalio import workflow\n\n# Pass the activities through the sandbox\nwith workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through():\n    from .my_activities import GreetingInfo, create_greeting_activity\n\n@workflow.defn\nclass GreetingWorkflow:\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        self._current_greeting = "<unset>"\n        self._greeting_info = GreetingInfo()\n        self._greeting_info_update = asyncio.Event()\n        self._complete = asyncio.Event()\n\n    @workflow.run\n    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:\n        self._greeting_info.name = name\n        while True:\n            # Store greeting\n            self._current_greeting = await workflow.execute_activity(\n                create_greeting_activity,\n                self._greeting_info,\n                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5),\n            )\n            workflow.logger.debug("Greeting set to %s", self._current_greeting)\n            \n            # Wait for salutation update or complete signal (this can be\n            # cancelled)\n            await asyncio.wait(\n                [\n                    asyncio.create_task(self._greeting_info_update.wait()),\n                    asyncio.create_task(self._complete.wait()),\n                ],\n                return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED,\n            )\n            if self._complete.is_set():\n                return self._current_greeting\n            self._greeting_info_update.clear()\n\n    @workflow.signal\n    async def update_salutation(self, salutation: str) -> None:\n        self._greeting_info.salutation = salutation\n        self._greeting_info_update.set()\n\n    @workflow.signal\n    async def complete_with_greeting(self) -> None:\n        self._complete.set()\n\n    @workflow.query\n    def current_greeting(self) -> str:\n        return self._current_greeting\n    \n    @workflow.update\n    def set_and_get_greeting(self, greeting: str) -> str:\n      old = self._current_greeting\n      self._current_greeting = greeting\n      return old\n\n```\n\nThis assumes there\'s an activity in `my_activities.py` like:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom temporalio import workflow\n\n@dataclass\nclass GreetingInfo:\n    salutation: str = "Hello"\n    name: str = "<unknown>"\n\n@activity.defn\ndef create_greeting_activity(info: GreetingInfo) -> str:\n    return f"{info.salutation}, {info.name}!"\n```\n\nSome things to note about the above workflow code:\n\n* Workflows run in a sandbox by default.\n  * Users are encouraged to define workflows in files with no side effects or other complicated code or unnecessary\n    imports to other third party libraries.\n  * Non-standard-library, non-`temporalio` imports should usually be "passed through" the sandbox. See the\n    [Workflow Sandbox](#workflow-sandbox) section for more details.\n* This workflow continually updates the queryable current greeting when signalled and can complete with the greeting on\n  a different signal\n* Workflows are always classes and must have a single `@workflow.run` which is an `async def` function\n* Workflow code must be deterministic. This means no `set` iteration, threading, no randomness, no external calls to\n  processes, no network IO, and no global state mutation. All code must run in the implicit `asyncio` event loop and be\n  deterministic. Also see the [Asyncio and Determinism](#asyncio-and-determinism) section later.\n* `@activity.defn` is explained in a later section. For normal simple string concatenation, this would just be done in\n  the workflow. The activity is for demonstration purposes only.\n* `workflow.execute_activity(create_greeting_activity, ...` is actually a typed signature, and MyPy will fail if the\n  `self._greeting_info` parameter is not a `GreetingInfo`\n\nHere are the decorators that can be applied:\n\n* `@workflow.defn` - Defines a workflow class\n  * Must be defined on the class given to the worker (ignored if present on a base class)\n  * Can have a `name` param to customize the workflow name, otherwise it defaults to the unqualified class name\n  * Can have `dynamic=True` which means all otherwise unhandled workflows fall through to this. If present, cannot have\n    `name` argument, and run method must accept a single parameter of `Sequence[temporalio.common.RawValue]` type. The\n    payload of the raw value can be converted via `workflow.payload_converter().from_payload`.\n* `@workflow.run` - Defines the primary workflow run method\n  * Must be defined on the same class as `@workflow.defn`, not a base class (but can _also_ be defined on the same\n    method of a base class)\n  * Exactly one method name must have this decorator, no more or less\n  * Must be defined on an `async def` method\n  * The method\'s arguments are the workflow\'s arguments\n  * The first parameter must be `self`, followed by positional arguments. Best practice is to only take a single\n    argument that is an object/dataclass of fields that can be added to as needed.\n* `@workflow.init` - Specifies that the `__init__`  method accepts the workflow\'s arguments.\n  * If present, may only be applied to the `__init__` method, the parameters of which must then be identical to those of\n    the `@workflow.run` method.\n  * The purpose of this decorator is to allow operations involving workflow arguments to be performed in the `__init__`\n    method, before any signal or update handler has a chance to execute.\n* `@workflow.signal` - Defines a method as a signal\n  * Can be defined on an `async` or non-`async` method at any point in the class hierarchy, but if the decorated method\n    is overridden, then the override must also be decorated.\n  * The method\'s arguments are the signal\'s arguments.\n  * Return value is ignored.\n  * May mutate workflow state, and make calls to other workflow APIs like starting activities, etc.\n  * Can have a `name` param to customize the signal name, otherwise it defaults to the unqualified method name.\n  * Can have `dynamic=True` which means all otherwise unhandled signals fall through to this. If present, cannot have\n    `name` argument, and method parameters must be `self`, a string signal name, and a\n    `Sequence[temporalio.common.RawValue]`.\n  * Non-dynamic method can only have positional arguments. Best practice is to only take a single argument that is an\n    object/dataclass of fields that can be added to as needed.\n  * See [Signal and update handlers](#signal-and-update-handlers) below\n* `@workflow.update` - Defines a method as an update\n  * Can be defined on an `async` or non-`async` method at any point in the class hierarchy, but if the decorated method\n    is overridden, then the override must also be decorated.\n  * May accept input and return a value\n  * The method\'s arguments are the update\'s arguments.\n  * May be `async` or non-`async`\n  * May mutate workflow state, and make calls to other workflow APIs like starting activities, etc.\n  * Also accepts the `name` and `dynamic` parameters like signal, with the same semantics.\n  * Update handlers may optionally define a validator method by decorating it with `@update_handler_method.validator`.\n    To reject an update before any events are written to history, throw an exception in a validator. Validators cannot \n    be `async`, cannot mutate workflow state, and return nothing.\n  * See [Signal and update handlers](#signal-and-update-handlers) below\n* `@workflow.query` - Defines a method as a query\n  * Should return a value\n  * Should not be `async`\n  * Temporal queries should never mutate anything in the workflow or call any calls that would mutate the workflow\n  * Also accepts the `name` and `dynamic` parameters like signal and update, with the same semantics.\n\n#### Running\n\nTo start a locally-defined workflow from a client, you can simply reference its method like so:\n\n```python\nfrom temporalio.client import Client\nfrom my_workflow_package import GreetingWorkflow\n\nasync def create_greeting(client: Client) -> str:\n    # Start the workflow\n    handle = await client.start_workflow(GreetingWorkflow.run, "my name", id="my-workflow-id", task_queue="my-task-queue")\n    # Change the salutation\n    await handle.signal(GreetingWorkflow.update_salutation, "Aloha")\n    # Tell it to complete\n    await handle.signal(GreetingWorkflow.complete_with_greeting)\n    # Wait and return result\n    return await handle.result()\n```\n\nSome things to note about the above code:\n\n* This uses the `GreetingWorkflow` from the previous section\n* The result of calling this function is `"Aloha, my name!"`\n* `id` and `task_queue` are required for running a workflow\n* `client.start_workflow` is typed, so MyPy would fail if `"my name"` were something besides a string\n* `handle.signal` is typed, so MyPy would fail if `"Aloha"` were something besides a string or if we provided a\n  parameter to the parameterless `complete_with_greeting`\n* `handle.result` is typed to the workflow itself, so MyPy would fail if we said this `create_greeting` returned\n  something besides a string\n\n#### Invoking Activities\n\n* Activities are started with non-async `workflow.start_activity()` which accepts either an activity function reference\n  or a string name.\n* A single argument to the activity is positional. Multiple arguments are not supported in the type-safe form of\n  start/execute activity and must be supplied via the `args` keyword argument.\n* Activity options are set as keyword arguments after the activity arguments. At least one of `start_to_close_timeout`\n  or `schedule_to_close_timeout` must be provided.\n* The result is an activity handle which is an `asyncio.Task` and supports basic task features\n* An async `workflow.execute_activity()` helper is provided which takes the same arguments as\n  `workflow.start_activity()` and `await`s on the result. This should be used in most cases unless advanced task\n  capabilities are needed.\n* Local activities work very similarly except the functions are `workflow.start_local_activity()` and\n  `workflow.execute_local_activity()`\n  * ⚠️Local activities are currently experimental\n* Activities can be methods of a class. Invokers should use `workflow.start_activity_method()`,\n  `workflow.execute_activity_method()`, `workflow.start_local_activity_method()`, and\n  `workflow.execute_local_activity_method()` instead.\n* Activities can callable classes (i.e. that define `__call__`). Invokers should use `workflow.start_activity_class()`,\n  `workflow.execute_activity_class()`, `workflow.start_local_activity_class()`, and\n  `workflow.execute_local_activity_class()` instead.\n\n#### Invoking Child Workflows\n\n* Child workflows are started with async `workflow.start_child_workflow()` which accepts either a workflow run method\n  reference or a string name. The arguments to the workflow are positional.\n* A single argument to the child workflow is positional. Multiple arguments are not supported in the type-safe form of\n  start/execute child workflow and must be supplied via the `args` keyword argument.\n* Child workflow options are set as keyword arguments after the arguments. At least `id` must be provided.\n* The `await` of the start does not complete until the start has been accepted by the server\n* The result is a child workflow handle which is an `asyncio.Task` and supports basic task features. The handle also has\n  some child info and supports signalling the child workflow\n* An async `workflow.execute_child_workflow()` helper is provided which takes the same arguments as\n  `workflow.start_child_workflow()` and `await`s on the result. This should be used in most cases unless advanced task\n  capabilities are needed.\n\n#### Timers\n\n* A timer is represented by normal `asyncio.sleep()` or a `workflow.sleep()` call\n* Timers are also implicitly started on any `asyncio` calls with timeouts (e.g. `asyncio.wait_for`)\n* Timers are Temporal server timers, not local ones, so sub-second resolution rarely has value\n* Calls that use a specific point in time, e.g. `call_at` or `timeout_at`, should be based on the current loop time\n  (i.e. `workflow.time()`) and not an actual point in time. This is because fixed times are translated to relative ones\n  by subtracting the current loop time which may not be the actual current time.\n\n#### Conditions\n\n* `workflow.wait_condition` is an async function that doesn\'t return until a provided callback returns true\n* A `timeout` can optionally be provided which will throw a `asyncio.TimeoutError` if reached (internally backed by\n  `asyncio.wait_for` which uses a timer)\n\n#### Asyncio and Determinism\n\nWorkflows must be deterministic. Workflows are backed by a custom\n[asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) event loop. This means many of the common `asyncio` calls work\nas normal. Some asyncio features are disabled such as:\n\n* Thread related calls such as `to_thread()`, `run_coroutine_threadsafe()`, `loop.run_in_executor()`, etc\n* Calls that alter the event loop such as `loop.close()`, `loop.stop()`, `loop.run_forever()`,\n  `loop.set_task_factory()`, etc\n* Calls that use anything external such as networking, subprocesses, disk IO, etc\n\nAlso, there are some `asyncio` utilities that internally use `set()` which can make them non-deterministic from one\nworker to the next. Therefore the following `asyncio` functions have `workflow`-module alternatives that are\ndeterministic:\n\n* `asyncio.as_completed()` - use `workflow.as_completed()`\n* `asyncio.wait()` - use `workflow.wait()`\n\n#### Asyncio Cancellation\n\nCancellation is done using `asyncio` [task cancellation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#task-cancellation).\nThis means that tasks are requested to be cancelled but can catch the\n[`asyncio.CancelledError`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-exceptions.html#asyncio.CancelledError), thus\nallowing them to perform some cleanup before allowing the cancellation to proceed (i.e. re-raising the error), or to\ndeny the cancellation entirely. It also means that\n[`asyncio.shield()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#shielding-from-cancellation) can be used to\nprotect tasks against cancellation.\n\nThe following tasks, when cancelled, perform a Temporal cancellation:\n\n* Activities - when the task executing an activity is cancelled, a cancellation request is sent to the activity\n* Child workflows - when the task starting or executing a child workflow is cancelled, a cancellation request is sent to\n  cancel the child workflow\n* Timers - when the task executing a timer is cancelled (whether started via sleep or timeout), the timer is cancelled\n\nWhen the workflow itself is requested to cancel, `Task.cancel` is called on the main workflow task. Therefore,\n`asyncio.CancelledError` can be caught in order to handle the cancel gracefully.\n\nWorkflows follow `asyncio` cancellation rules exactly which can cause confusion among Python developers. Cancelling a\ntask doesn\'t always cancel the thing it created. For example, given\n`task = asyncio.create_task(workflow.start_child_workflow(...`, calling `task.cancel` does not cancel the child\nworkflow, it only cancels the starting of it, which has no effect if it has already started. However, cancelling the\nresult of `handle = await workflow.start_child_workflow(...` or\n`task = asyncio.create_task(workflow.execute_child_workflow(...` _does_ cancel the child workflow.\n\nAlso, due to Temporal rules, a cancellation request is a state not an event. Therefore, repeated cancellation requests\nare not delivered, only the first. If the workflow chooses swallow a cancellation, it cannot be requested again.\n\n#### Workflow Utilities\n\nWhile running in a workflow, in addition to features documented elsewhere, the following items are available from the\n`temporalio.workflow` package:\n\n* `continue_as_new()` - Async function to stop the workflow immediately and continue as new\n* `info()` - Returns information about the current workflow\n* `logger` - A logger for use in a workflow (properly skips logging on replay)\n* `now()` - Returns the "current time" from the workflow\'s perspective\n\n#### Exceptions\n\n* Workflows/updates can raise exceptions to fail the workflow or the "workflow task" (i.e. suspend the workflow\n  in a retrying state).\n* Exceptions that are instances of `temporalio.exceptions.FailureError` will fail the workflow with that exception\n  * For failing the workflow explicitly with a user exception, use `temporalio.exceptions.ApplicationError`. This can\n    be marked non-retryable or include details as needed.\n  * Other exceptions that come from activity execution, child execution, cancellation, etc are already instances of\n    `FailureError` and will fail the workflow when uncaught.\n* Update handlers are special: an instance of `temporalio.exceptions.FailureError` raised in an update handler will fail\n  the update instead of failing the workflow.\n* All other exceptions fail the "workflow task" which means the workflow will continually retry until the workflow is\n  fixed. This is helpful for bad code or other non-predictable exceptions. To actually fail the workflow, use an\n  `ApplicationError` as mentioned above.\n\nThis default can be changed by providing a list of exception types to `workflow_failure_exception_types` when creating a\n`Worker` or `failure_exception_types` on the `@workflow.defn` decorator. If a workflow-thrown exception is an instance\nof any type in either list, it will fail the workflow (or update) instead of the workflow task. This means a value of\n`[Exception]` will cause every exception to fail the workflow instead of the workflow task. Also, as a special case, if\n`temporalio.workflow.NondeterminismError` (or any superclass of it) is set, non-deterministic exceptions will fail the\nworkflow. WARNING: These settings are experimental.\n\n#### Signal and update handlers\n\nSignal and update handlers are defined using decorated methods as shown in the example [above](#definition). Client code\nsends signals and updates using `workflow_handle.signal`, `workflow_handle.execute_update`, or\n`workflow_handle.start_update`. When the workflow receives one of these requests, it starts an `asyncio.Task` executing\nthe corresponding handler method with the argument(s) from the request.\n\nThe handler methods may be `async def` and can do all the async operations described above (e.g. invoking activities and\nchild workflows, and waiting on timers and conditions). Notice that this means that handler tasks will be executing\nconcurrently with respect to each other and the main workflow task. Use\n[asyncio.Lock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html#lock) and\n[asyncio.Semaphore](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html#semaphore) if necessary.\n\nYour main workflow task may finish as a result of successful completion, cancellation, continue-as-new, or failure. You\nshould ensure that all in-progress signal and update handler tasks have finished before this happens; if you do not, you\nwill see a warning (the warning can be disabled via the `workflow.signal`/`workflow.update` decorators). One way to\nensure that handler tasks have finished is to wait on the `workflow.all_handlers_finished` condition:\n```python\nawait workflow.wait_condition(workflow.all_handlers_finished)\n```\n#### External Workflows\n\n* `workflow.get_external_workflow_handle()` inside a workflow returns a handle to interact with another workflow\n* `workflow.get_external_workflow_handle_for()` can be used instead for a type safe handle\n* `await handle.signal()` can be called on the handle to signal the external workflow\n* `await handle.cancel()` can be called on the handle to send a cancel to the external workflow\n\n#### Testing\n\nWorkflow testing can be done in an integration-test fashion against a real server, however it is hard to simulate\ntimeouts and other long time-based code. Using the time-skipping workflow test environment can help there.\n\nThe time-skipping `temporalio.testing.WorkflowEnvironment` can be created via the static async `start_time_skipping()`.\nThis internally downloads the Temporal time-skipping test server to a temporary directory if it doesn\'t already exist,\nthen starts the test server which has special APIs for skipping time.\n\n**NOTE:** The time-skipping test environment does not work on ARM. The SDK will try to download the x64 binary on macOS\nfor use with the Intel emulator, but for Linux or Windows ARM there is no proper time-skipping test server at this time.\n\n##### Automatic Time Skipping\n\nAnytime a workflow result is waited on, the time-skipping server automatically advances to the next event it can. To\nmanually advance time before waiting on the result of a workflow, the `WorkflowEnvironment.sleep` method can be used.\n\nHere\'s a simple example of a workflow that sleeps for 24 hours:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom temporalio import workflow\n\n@workflow.defn\nclass WaitADayWorkflow:\n    @workflow.run\n    async def run(self) -> str:\n        await asyncio.sleep(24 * 60 * 60)\n        return "all done"\n```\n\nAn integration test of this workflow would be way too slow. However the time-skipping server automatically skips to the\nnext event when we wait on the result. Here\'s a test for that workflow:\n\n```python\nfrom temporalio.testing import WorkflowEnvironment\nfrom temporalio.worker import Worker\n\nasync def test_wait_a_day_workflow():\n    async with await WorkflowEnvironment.start_time_skipping() as env:\n        async with Worker(env.client, task_queue="tq1", workflows=[WaitADayWorkflow]):\n            assert "all done" == await env.client.execute_workflow(WaitADayWorkflow.run, id="wf1", task_queue="tq1")\n```\n\nThat test will run almost instantly. This is because by calling `execute_workflow` on our client, we have asked the\nenvironment to automatically skip time as much as it can (basically until the end of the workflow or until an activity\nis run).\n\nTo disable automatic time-skipping while waiting for a workflow result, run code inside a\n`with env.auto_time_skipping_disabled():` block.\n\n##### Manual Time Skipping\n\nUntil a workflow is waited on, all time skipping in the time-skipping environment is done manually via\n`WorkflowEnvironment.sleep`.\n\nHere\'s workflow that waits for a signal or times out:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom temporalio import workflow\n\n@workflow.defn\nclass SignalWorkflow:\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        self.signal_received = False\n\n    @workflow.run\n    async def run(self) -> str:\n        # Wait for signal or timeout in 45 seconds\n        try:\n            await workflow.wait_condition(lambda: self.signal_received, timeout=45)\n            return "got signal"\n        except asyncio.TimeoutError:\n            return "got timeout"\n\n    @workflow.signal\n    def some_signal(self) -> None:\n        self.signal_received = True\n```\n\nTo test a normal signal, you might:\n\n```python\nfrom temporalio.testing import WorkflowEnvironment\nfrom temporalio.worker import Worker\n\nasync def test_signal_workflow():\n    async with await WorkflowEnvironment.start_time_skipping() as env:\n        async with Worker(env.client, task_queue="tq1", workflows=[SignalWorkflow]):\n            # Start workflow, send signal, check result\n            handle = await env.client.start_workflow(SignalWorkflow.run, id="wf1", task_queue="tq1")\n            await handle.signal(SignalWorkflow.some_signal)\n            assert "got signal" == await handle.result()\n```\n\nBut how would you test the timeout part? Like so:\n\n```python\nfrom temporalio.testing import WorkflowEnvironment\nfrom temporalio.worker import Worker\n\nasync def test_signal_workflow_timeout():\n    async with await WorkflowEnvironment.start_time_skipping() as env:\n        async with Worker(env.client, task_queue="tq1", workflows=[SignalWorkflow]):\n            # Start workflow, advance time past timeout, check result\n            handle = await env.client.start_workflow(SignalWorkflow.run, id="wf1", task_queue="tq1")\n            await env.sleep(50)\n            assert "got timeout" == await handle.result()\n```\n\nAlso, the current time of the workflow environment can be obtained via the async `WorkflowEnvironment.get_current_time`\nmethod.\n\n##### Mocking Activities\n\nActivities are just functions decorated with `@activity.defn`. Simply write different ones and pass those to the worker\nto have different activities called during the test.\n\n#### Workflow Sandbox\n\nBy default workflows are run in a sandbox to help avoid non-deterministic code. If a call that is known to be\nnon-deterministic is performed, an exception will be thrown in the workflow which will "fail the task" which means the\nworkflow will not progress until fixed.\n\nThe sandbox is not foolproof and non-determinism can still occur. It is simply a best-effort way to catch bad code\nearly. Users are encouraged to define their workflows in files with no other side effects.\n\nThe sandbox offers a mechanism to pass through modules from outside the sandbox. By default this already includes all\nstandard library modules and Temporal modules. **For performance and behavior reasons, users are encouraged to pass\nthrough all third party modules whose calls will be deterministic.** This includes modules containing the activities to\nbe referenced in workflows. See "Passthrough Modules" below on how to do this.\n\nIf you are getting an error like:\n\n> temporalio.worker.workflow_sandbox._restrictions.RestrictedWorkflowAccessError: Cannot access\n> http.client.IncompleteRead.\\_\\_mro_entries\\_\\_ from inside a workflow. If this is code from a module not used in a\n> workflow or known to only be used deterministically from a workflow, mark the import as pass through.\n\nThen you are either using an invalid construct from the workflow, this is a known limitation of the sandbox, or most\ncommonly this is from a module that is safe to pass through (see "Passthrough Modules" section below).\n\n##### How the Sandbox Works\n\nThe sandbox is made up of two components that work closely together:\n\n* Global state isolation\n* Restrictions preventing known non-deterministic library calls\n\nGlobal state isolation is performed by using `exec`. Upon workflow start, the file that the workflow is defined in is\nimported into a new sandbox created for that workflow run. In order to keep the sandbox performant a known set of\n"passthrough modules" are passed through from outside of the sandbox when they are imported. These are expected to be\nside-effect free on import and have their non-deterministic aspects restricted. By default the entire Python standard\nlibrary, `temporalio`, and a couple of other modules are passed through from outside of the sandbox. To update this\nlist, see "Customizing the Sandbox".\n\nRestrictions preventing known non-deterministic library calls are achieved using proxy objects on modules wrapped around\nthe custom importer set in the sandbox. Many restrictions apply at workflow import time and workflow run time, while\nsome restrictions only apply at workflow run time. A default set of restrictions is included that prevents most\ndangerous standard library calls. However it is known in Python that some otherwise-non-deterministic invocations, like\nreading a file from disk via `open` or using `os.environ`, are done as part of importing modules. To customize what is\nand isn\'t restricted, see "Customizing the Sandbox".\n\n##### Avoiding the Sandbox\n\nThere are three increasingly-scoped ways to avoid the sandbox. Users are discouraged from avoiding the sandbox if\npossible.\n\nTo remove restrictions around a particular block of code, use `with temporalio.workflow.unsafe.sandbox_unrestricted():`.\nThe workflow will still be running in the sandbox, but no restrictions for invalid library calls will be applied.\n\nTo run an entire workflow outside of a sandbox, set `sandboxed=False` on the `@workflow.defn` decorator when defining\nit. This will run the entire workflow outside of the workflow which means it can share global state and other bad\nthings.\n\nTo disable the sandbox entirely for a worker, set the `Worker` init\'s `workflow_runner` keyword argument to \n`temporalio.worker.UnsandboxedWorkflowRunner()`. This value is defaulted to\n`temporalio.worker.workflow_sandbox.SandboxedWorkflowRunner()` so by changing it to the unsandboxed runner, the sandbox\nwill not be used at all.\n\n##### Customizing the Sandbox\n\n⚠️ WARNING: APIs in the `temporalio.worker.workflow_sandbox` module are not yet considered stable and may change in\nfuture releases.\n\nWhen creating the `Worker`, the `workflow_runner` is defaulted to\n`temporalio.worker.workflow_sandbox.SandboxedWorkflowRunner()`. The `SandboxedWorkflowRunner`\'s init accepts a\n`restrictions` keyword argument that is defaulted to `SandboxRestrictions.default`. The `SandboxRestrictions` dataclass\nis immutable and contains three fields that can be customized, but only two have notable value. See below.\n\n###### Passthrough Modules\n\nBy default the sandbox completely reloads non-standard-library and non-Temporal modules for every workflow run. To make\nthe sandbox quicker and use less memory when importing known-side-effect-free third party modules, they can be marked\nas passthrough modules.\n\n**For performance and behavior reasons, users are encouraged to pass through all third party modules whose calls will be\ndeterministic.**\n\nOne way to pass through a module is at import time in the workflow file using the `imports_passed_through` context\nmanager like so:\n\n```python\n# my_workflow_file.py\n\nfrom temporalio import workflow\n\nwith workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through():\n    import pydantic\n\n@workflow.defn\nclass MyWorkflow:\n    ...\n```\n\nAlternatively, this can be done at worker creation time by customizing the runner\'s restrictions. For example:\n\n```python\nmy_worker = Worker(\n  ...,\n  workflow_runner=SandboxedWorkflowRunner(\n    restrictions=SandboxRestrictions.default.with_passthrough_modules("pydantic")\n  )\n)\n```\n\nIn both of these cases, now the `pydantic` module will be passed through from outside of the sandbox instead of\nbeing reloaded for every workflow run.\n\nIf users are sure that no imports they use in workflow files will ever need to be sandboxed (meaning all calls within\nare deterministic and never mutate shared, global state), the `passthrough_all_modules` option can be set on the\nrestrictions or the `with_passthrough_all_modules` helper can by used, for example:\n\n```python\nmy_worker = Worker(\n  ...,\n  workflow_runner=SandboxedWorkflowRunner(\n    restrictions=SandboxRestrictions.default.with_passthrough_all_modules()\n  )\n)\n```\n\nNote, some calls from the module may still be checked for invalid calls at runtime for certain builtins.\n\n###### Invalid Module Members\n\n`SandboxRestrictions.invalid_module_members` contains a root matcher that applies to all module members. This already\nhas a default set which includes things like `datetime.date.today()` which should never be called from a workflow. To\nremove this restriction:\n\n```python\nmy_restrictions = dataclasses.replace(\n    SandboxRestrictions.default,\n    invalid_module_members=SandboxRestrictions.invalid_module_members_default.with_child_unrestricted(\n      "datetime", "date", "today",\n    ),\n)\nmy_worker = Worker(..., workflow_runner=SandboxedWorkflowRunner(restrictions=my_restrictions))\n```\n\nRestrictions can also be added by `|`\'ing together matchers, for example to restrict the `datetime.date` class from\nbeing used altogether:\n\n```python\nmy_restrictions = dataclasses.replace(\n    SandboxRestrictions.default,\n    invalid_module_members=SandboxRestrictions.invalid_module_members_default | SandboxMatcher(\n      children={"datetime": SandboxMatcher(use={"date"})},\n    ),\n)\nmy_worker = Worker(..., workflow_runner=SandboxedWorkflowRunner(restrictions=my_restrictions))\n```\n\nSee the API for more details on exact fields and their meaning.\n\n##### Known Sandbox Issues\n\nBelow are known sandbox issues. As the sandbox is developed and matures, some may be resolved.\n\n###### Global Import/Builtins\n\nCurrently the sandbox references/alters the global `sys.modules` and `builtins` fields while running workflow code. In\norder to prevent affecting other sandboxed code, thread locals are leveraged to only intercept these values during the\nworkflow thread running. Therefore, technically if top-level import code starts a thread, it may lose sandbox\nprotection.\n\n###### Sandbox is not Secure\n\nThe sandbox is built to catch many non-deterministic and state sharing issues, but it is not secure. Some known bad\ncalls are intercepted, but for performance reasons, every single attribute get/set cannot be checked. Therefore a simple\ncall like `setattr(temporalio.common, "__my_key", "my value")` will leak across sandbox runs.\n\nThe sandbox is only a helper, it does not provide full protection.\n\n###### Sandbox Performance\n\nThe sandbox does not add significant CPU or memory overhead for workflows that are in files which only import standard\nlibrary modules. This is because they are passed through from outside of the sandbox. However, every\nnon-standard-library import that is performed at the top of the same file the workflow is in will add CPU overhead (the\nmodule is re-imported every workflow run) and memory overhead (each module independently cached as part of the workflow\nrun for isolation reasons). This becomes more apparent for large numbers of workflow runs.\n\nTo mitigate this, users should:\n\n* Define workflows in files that have as few non-standard-library imports as possible\n* Alter the max workflow cache and/or max concurrent workflows settings if memory grows too large\n* Set third-party libraries as passthrough modules if they are known to be side-effect free\n\n###### Extending Restricted Classes\n\nExtending a restricted class causes Python to instantiate the restricted metaclass which is unsupported. Therefore if\nyou attempt to use a class in the sandbox that extends a restricted class, it will fail. For example, if you have a\n`class MyZipFile(zipfile.ZipFile)` and try to use that class inside a workflow, it will fail.\n\nClasses used inside the workflow should not extend restricted classes. For situations where third-party modules need to\nat import time, they should be marked as pass through modules.\n\n###### Certain Standard Library Calls on Restricted Objects\n\nIf an object is restricted, internal C Python validation may fail in some cases. For example, running\n`dict.items(os.__dict__)` will fail with:\n\n> descriptor \'items\' for \'dict\' objects doesn\'t apply to a \'_RestrictedProxy\' object\n\nThis is a low-level check that cannot be subverted. The solution is to not use restricted objects inside the sandbox.\nFor situations where third-party modules need to at import time, they should be marked as pass through modules.\n\n###### is_subclass of ABC-based Restricted Classes\n\nDue to [https://bugs.python.org/issue44847](https://bugs.python.org/issue44847), classes that are wrapped and then\nchecked to see if they are subclasses of another via `is_subclass` may fail (see also\n[this wrapt issue](https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt/issues/130)).\n\n\n### Activities\n\n#### Definition\n\nActivities are decorated with `@activity.defn` like so:\n\n```python\nfrom temporalio import activity\n\n@activity.defn\ndef say_hello_activity(name: str) -> str:\n    return f"Hello, {name}!"\n```\n\nSome things to note about activity definitions:\n\n* The `say_hello_activity` is synchronous which is the recommended activity type (see "Types of Activities" below), but\n  it can be `async`\n* A custom name for the activity can be set with a decorator argument, e.g. `@activity.defn(name="my activity")`\n* Long running activities should regularly heartbeat and handle cancellation\n* Activities can only have positional arguments. Best practice is to only take a single argument that is an\n  object/dataclass of fields that can be added to as needed.\n* Activities can be defined on methods instead of top-level functions. This allows the instance to carry state that an\n  activity may need (e.g. a DB connection). The instance method should be what is registered with the worker.\n* Activities can also be defined on callable classes (i.e. classes with `__call__`). An instance of the class should be\n  what is registered with the worker.\n* The `@activity.defn` can have `dynamic=True` set which means all otherwise unhandled activities fall through to this.\n  If present, cannot have `name` argument, and the activity function must accept a single parameter of\n  `Sequence[temporalio.common.RawValue]`. The payload of the raw value can be converted via\n  `activity.payload_converter().from_payload`.\n\n#### Types of Activities\n\nThere are 3 types of activity callables accepted and described below: synchronous multithreaded, synchronous\nmultiprocess/other, and asynchronous. Only positional parameters are allowed in activity callables.\n\n##### Synchronous Activities\n\nSynchronous activities, i.e. functions that do not have `async def`, can be used with workers, but the\n`activity_executor` worker parameter must be set with a `concurrent.futures.Executor` instance to use for executing the\nactivities.\n\nAll long running, non-local activities should heartbeat so they can be cancelled. Cancellation in threaded activities\nthrows but multiprocess/other activities does not. The sections below on each synchronous type explain further. There\nare also calls on the context that can check for cancellation. For more information, see "Activity Context" and\n"Heartbeating and Cancellation" sections later.\n\nNote, all calls from an activity to functions in the `temporalio.activity` package are powered by\n[contextvars](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html). Therefore, new threads starting _inside_ of\nactivities must `copy_context()` and then `.run()` manually to ensure `temporalio.activity` calls like `heartbeat` still\nfunction in the new threads.\n\nIf any activity ever throws a `concurrent.futures.BrokenExecutor`, the failure is consisted unrecoverable and the worker\nwill fail and shutdown.\n\n###### Synchronous Multithreaded Activities\n\nIf `activity_executor` is set to an instance of `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` then the synchronous activities\nare considered multithreaded activities. If `max_workers` is not set to at least the worker\'s\n`max_concurrent_activities` setting a warning will be issued. Besides `activity_executor`, no other worker parameters\nare required for synchronous multithreaded activities.\n\nBy default, cancellation of a synchronous multithreaded activity is done via a `temporalio.exceptions.CancelledError`\nthrown into the activity thread. Activities that do not wish to have cancellation thrown can set\n`no_thread_cancel_exception=True` in the `@activity.defn` decorator.\n\nCode that wishes to be temporarily shielded from the cancellation exception can run inside\n`with activity.shield_thread_cancel_exception():`. But once the last nested form of that block is finished, even if\nthere is a return statement within, it will throw the cancellation if there was one. A `try` +\n`except temporalio.exceptions.CancelledError` would have to surround the `with` to handle the cancellation explicitly.\n\n###### Synchronous Multiprocess/Other Activities\n\nIf `activity_executor` is set to an instance of `concurrent.futures.Executor` that is _not_\n`concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, then the synchronous activities are considered multiprocess/other activities.\nUsers should prefer threaded activities over multiprocess ones since, among other reasons, threaded activities can raise\non cancellation.\n\nThese require special primitives for heartbeating and cancellation. The `shared_state_manager` worker parameter must be\nset to an instance of `temporalio.worker.SharedStateManager`. The most common implementation can be created by passing a\n`multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager` (i.e. result of `multiprocessing.managers.Manager()`) to\n`temporalio.worker.SharedStateManager.create_from_multiprocessing()`.\n\nAlso, all of these activity functions must be\n["picklable"](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#what-can-be-pickled-and-unpickled).\n\n##### Asynchronous Activities\n\nAsynchronous activities are functions defined with `async def`. Asynchronous activities are often much more performant\nthan synchronous ones. When using asynchronous activities no special worker parameters are needed.\n\n**⚠️ WARNING: Do not block the thread in `async def` Python functions. This can stop the processing of the rest of the\nTemporal.**\n\nCancellation for asynchronous activities is done via\n[`asyncio.Task.cancel`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task.cancel). This means that\n`asyncio.CancelledError` will be raised (and can be caught, but it is not recommended). A non-local activity must\nheartbeat to receive cancellation and there are other ways to be notified about cancellation (see "Activity Context" and\n"Heartbeating and Cancellation" later).\n\n#### Activity Context\n\nDuring activity execution, an implicit activity context is set as a\n[context variable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html). The context variable itself is not visible, but\ncalls in the `temporalio.activity` package make use of it. Specifically:\n\n* `in_activity()` - Whether an activity context is present\n* `info()` - Returns the immutable info of the currently running activity\n* `heartbeat(*details)` - Record a heartbeat\n* `is_cancelled()` - Whether a cancellation has been requested on this activity\n* `wait_for_cancelled()` - `async` call to wait for cancellation request\n* `wait_for_cancelled_sync(timeout)` - Synchronous blocking call to wait for cancellation request\n* `shield_thread_cancel_exception()` - Context manager for use in `with` clauses by synchronous multithreaded activities\n  to prevent cancel exception from being thrown during the block of code\n* `is_worker_shutdown()` - Whether the worker has started graceful shutdown\n* `wait_for_worker_shutdown()` - `async` call to wait for start of graceful worker shutdown\n* `wait_for_worker_shutdown_sync(timeout)` - Synchronous blocking call to wait for start of graceful worker shutdown\n* `raise_complete_async()` - Raise an error that this activity will be completed asynchronously (i.e. after return of\n  the activity function in a separate client call)\n\nWith the exception of `in_activity()`, if any of the functions are called outside of an activity context, an error\noccurs. Synchronous activities cannot call any of the `async` functions.\n\n##### Heartbeating and Cancellation\n\nIn order for a non-local activity to be notified of cancellation requests, it must be given a `heartbeat_timeout` at\ninvocation time and invoke `temporalio.activity.heartbeat()` inside the activity. It is strongly recommended that all\nbut the fastest executing activities call this function regularly. "Types of Activities" has specifics on cancellation\nfor synchronous and asynchronous activities.\n\nIn addition to obtaining cancellation information, heartbeats also support detail data that is persisted on the server\nfor retrieval during activity retry. If an activity calls `temporalio.activity.heartbeat(123, 456)` and then fails and\nis retried, `temporalio.activity.info().heartbeat_details` will return an iterable containing `123` and `456` on the\nnext run.\n\nHeartbeating has no effect on local activities.\n\n##### Worker Shutdown\n\nAn activity can react to a worker shutdown. Using `is_worker_shutdown` or one of the `wait_for_worker_shutdown`\nfunctions an activity can react to a shutdown.\n\nWhen the `graceful_shutdown_timeout` worker parameter is given a `datetime.timedelta`, on shutdown the worker will\nnotify activities of the graceful shutdown. Once that timeout has passed (or if wasn\'t set), the worker will perform\ncancellation of all outstanding activities.\n\nThe `shutdown()` invocation will wait on all activities to complete, so if a long-running activity does not at least\nrespect cancellation, the shutdown may never complete.\n\n#### Testing\n\nUnit testing an activity or any code that could run in an activity is done via the\n`temporalio.testing.ActivityEnvironment` class. Simply instantiate this and any callable + params passed to `run` will\nbe invoked inside the activity context. The following are attributes/methods on the environment that can be used to\naffect calls activity code might make to functions on the `temporalio.activity` package.\n\n* `info` property can be set to customize what is returned from `activity.info()`\n* `on_heartbeat` property can be set to handle `activity.heartbeat()` calls\n* `cancel()` can be invoked to simulate a cancellation of the activity\n* `worker_shutdown()` can be invoked to simulate a worker shutdown during execution of the activity\n\n### Workflow Replay\n\nGiven a workflow\'s history, it can be replayed locally to check for things like non-determinism errors. For example,\nassuming `history_str` is populated with a JSON string history either exported from the web UI or from `tctl`, the\nfollowing function will replay it:\n\n```python\nfrom temporalio.client import WorkflowHistory\nfrom temporalio.worker import Replayer\n\nasync def run_replayer(history_str: str):\n  replayer = Replayer(workflows=[SayHello])\n  await replayer.replay_workflow(WorkflowHistory.from_json(history_str))\n```\n\nThis will throw an error if any non-determinism is detected.\n\nReplaying from workflow history is a powerful concept that many use to test that workflow alterations won\'t cause\nnon-determinisms with past-complete workflows. The following code will make sure that all workflow histories for a\ncertain workflow type (i.e. workflow class) are safe with the current code.\n\n```python\nfrom temporalio.client import Client, WorkflowHistory\nfrom temporalio.worker import Replayer\n\nasync def check_past_histories(my_client: Client):\n  replayer = Replayer(workflows=[SayHello])\n  await replayer.replay_workflows(\n    await my_client.list_workflows("WorkflowType = \'SayHello\'").map_histories(),\n  )\n```\n\n### OpenTelemetry Support\n\nOpenTelemetry support requires the optional `opentelemetry` dependencies which are part of the `opentelemetry` extra.\nWhen using `pip`, running\n\n    pip install \'temporalio[opentelemetry]\'\n\nwill install needed dependencies. Then the `temporalio.contrib.opentelemetry.TracingInterceptor` can be created and set\nas an interceptor on the `interceptors` argument of `Client.connect`. When set, spans will be created for all client\ncalls and for all activity and workflow invocations on the worker, spans will be created and properly serialized through\nthe server to give one proper trace for a workflow execution.\n\n### Protobuf 3.x vs 4.x\n\nPython currently has two somewhat-incompatible protobuf library versions - the 3.x series and the 4.x series. Python\ncurrently recommends 4.x and that is the primary supported version. Some libraries like\n[Pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi) require 4.x. Other libraries such as [ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/onnx) and\n[Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit), for one reason or another, have/will not leave 3.x.\n\nTo support these, Temporal Python SDK allows any protobuf library >= 3.19. However, the C extension in older Python\nversions can cause issues with the sandbox due to global state sharing. Temporal strongly recommends using the latest\nprotobuf 4.x library unless you absolutely cannot at which point some proto libraries may have to be marked as\n[Passthrough Modules](#passthrough-modules).\n\n### Known Compatibility Issues\n\nBelow are known compatibility issues with the Python SDK.\n\n#### gevent Patching\n\nWhen using `gevent.monkey.patch_all()`, asyncio event loops can get messed up, especially those using custom event loops\nlike Temporal. See [this gevent issue](https://github.com/gevent/gevent/issues/982). This is a known incompatibility and\nusers are encouraged to not use gevent in asyncio applications (including Temporal). But if you must, there is\n[a sample](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/tree/main/gevent_async) showing how it is possible.\n\n# Development\n\nThe Python SDK is built to work with Python 3.9 and newer. It is built using\n[SDK Core](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/) which is written in Rust.\n\n### Building\n\n#### Prepare\n\nTo build the SDK from source for use as a dependency, the following prerequisites are required:\n\n* [Python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.9\n  * Make sure the latest version of `pip` is in use\n* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)\n* [Protobuf Compiler](https://protobuf.dev/)\n* [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) (e.g. `python -m pip install poetry`)\n* [poe](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) (e.g. `python -m pip install poethepoet`)\n\nmacOS note: If errors are encountered, it may be better to install Python and Rust as recommended from their websites\ninstead of via `brew`.\n\nWith the prerequisites installed, first clone the SDK repository recursively:\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python.git\ncd sdk-python\n```\n\nUse `poetry` to install the dependencies with `--no-root` to not install this package (because we still need to build\nit):\n\n```bash\npoetry install --no-root --all-extras\n```\n\n#### Build\n\nNow perform the release build:\n\n> This will take a while because Rust will compile the core project in release mode (see [Local SDK development\nenvironment](#local-sdk-development-environment) for the quicker approach to local development).\n\n```bash\npoetry build\n```\n\nThe compiled wheel doesn\'t have the exact right tags yet for use, so run this script to fix it:\n\n```bash\npoe fix-wheel\n```\n\nThe `whl` wheel file in `dist/` is now ready to use.\n\n#### Use\n\nThe wheel can now be installed into any virtual environment.\n\nFor example,\n[create a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments)\nsomewhere and then run the following inside the virtual environment:\n\n```bash\npip install wheel\n```\n\n```bash\npip install /path/to/cloned/sdk-python/dist/*.whl\n```\n\nCreate this Python file at `example.py`:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom temporalio import workflow, activity\nfrom temporalio.client import Client\nfrom temporalio.worker import Worker\n\n@workflow.defn\nclass SayHello:\n    @workflow.run\n    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:\n        return f"Hello, {name}!"\n\nasync def main():\n    client = await Client.connect("localhost:7233")\n    async with Worker(client, task_queue="my-task-queue", workflows=[SayHello]):\n        result = await client.execute_workflow(SayHello.run, "Temporal",\n            id="my-workflow-id", task_queue="my-task-queue")\n        print(f"Result: {result}")\n\nif __name__ == "__main__":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nAssuming there is a [local Temporal server](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/server/quick-install/) running, execute the\nfile with `python` (or `python3` if necessary):\n\n```bash\npython example.py\n```\n\nIt should output:\n\n    Result: Hello, Temporal!\n\n### Local SDK development environment\n\nFor local development, it is often quicker to use debug builds and a local virtual environment.\n\nWhile not required, it often helps IDEs if we put the virtual environment `.venv` directory in the project itself. This\ncan be configured system-wide via:\n\n```bash\npoetry config virtualenvs.in-project true\n```\n\nNow perform the same steps as the "Prepare" section above by installing the prerequisites, cloning the project,\ninstalling dependencies, and generating the protobuf code:\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python.git\ncd sdk-python\npoetry install --no-root --all-extras\n```\n\nNow compile the Rust extension in develop mode which is quicker than release mode:\n\n```bash\npoe build-develop\n```\n\nThat step can be repeated for any Rust changes made.\n\nThe environment is now ready to develop in.\n\n#### Testing\n\nTo execute tests:\n\n```bash\npoe test\n```\n\nThis runs against [Temporalite](https://github.com/temporalio/temporalite). To run against the time-skipping test\nserver, pass `--workflow-environment time-skipping`. To run against the `default` namespace of an already-running\nserver, pass the `host:port` to `--workflow-environment`. Can also use regular pytest arguments. For example, here\'s how\nto run a single test with debug logs on the console:\n\n```bash\npoe test -s --log-cli-level=DEBUG -k test_sync_activity_thread_cancel_caught\n```\n\n#### Proto Generation and Testing\n\nTo allow for backwards compatibility, protobuf code is generated on the 3.x series of the protobuf library. To generate\nprotobuf code, you must be on Python <= 3.10, and then run `poetry add "protobuf<4"` +\n`poetry install --no-root --all-extras`. Then the protobuf files can be generated via `poe gen-protos`. Tests can be run\nfor protobuf version 3 by setting the `TEMPORAL_TEST_PROTO3` env var to `1` prior to running tests.\n\nDo not commit `poetry.lock` or `pyproject.toml` changes. To go back from this downgrade, restore both of those files\nand run `poetry install --no-root --all-extras`. Make sure you `poe format` the results.\n\nFor a less system-intrusive approach, you can (note this approach [may have a bug](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/543)):\n```shell\ndocker build -f scripts/_proto/Dockerfile .\ndocker run --rm -v "${PWD}/temporalio/api:/api_new" -v "${PWD}/temporalio/bridge/proto:/bridge_new" <just built image sha>\npoe format\n```\n\n### Style\n\n* Mostly [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). Notable exceptions:\n  * We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting, so that takes precedence\n  * In tests and example code, can import individual classes/functions to make it more readable. Can also do this for\n    rarely in library code for some Python common items (e.g. `dataclass` or `partial`), but not allowed to do this for\n    any `temporalio` packages (except `temporalio.types`) or any classes/functions that aren\'t clear when unqualified.\n  * We allow relative imports for private packages\n  * We allow `@staticmethod`\n',
