#### in python how do i measure import time  

I'll help you create a script to measure import time. Let me create a new file for this purpose.

measure_imports.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
import time
import importlib
import sys
from typing import Dict

def measure_import_time(module_name: str) -> float:
    """Measure the time taken to import a module.
    
    Args:
        module_name: Name of the module to import
        
    Returns:
        Time taken in seconds
    """
    start_time = time.time()
    importlib.import_module(module_name)
    end_time = time.time()
    return end_time - start_time

def measure_multiple_imports(module_names: list[str]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Measure import times for multiple modules.
    
    Args:
        module_names: List of module names to import
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary mapping module names to import times
    """
    results = {}
    for module in module_names:
        # Remove module if already imported
        if module in sys.modules:
            del sys.modules[module]
        results[module] = measure_import_time(module)
    return results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    modules_to_test = ["numpy", "pandas", "requests"]
    results = measure_multiple_imports(modules_to_test)
    
    print("\nImport times:")
    for module, import_time in results.items():
        print(f"{module}: {import_time:.4f} seconds")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You can run this script directly to measure import times for some common packages, or import and use its functions in your own code.

To run the example:
```bash
python measure_imports.py
```

Note: Make sure you have the packages installed that you want to measure (numpy, pandas, requests in the example). You can modify the `modules_to_test` list to measure different packages.

```

This script provides two main functions:
1. `measure_import_time()` - Measures import time for a single module
2. `measure_multiple_imports()` - Measures import times for multiple modules

To use it, you can run:

```bash
python measure_imports.py
```

Note: Make sure you have the modules you want to test already installed. For the example modules, you would need:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas requests
```

This error occurs because you're trying to use a newer metadata feature (license-file) with an older metadata version. To fix this, we need to modify the project configuration in pyproject.toml to use a newer metadata version.

I'll need to see the contents of:

pyproject.toml

Please add this file to the chat so I can help update the build configuration to use the correct metadata version.

The error occurs because you're trying to upload a package with a newer metadata feature (license-file) but using an older metadata version. We need to add the `dynamic` field to specify metadata version 2.2 compatibility and handle the license information appropriately.

Let's modify the pyproject.toml:

pyproject.toml
```toml
<<<<<<< SEARCH
[project]
name = "langmem"
version = "0.0.7rc1"
description = "Prebuilt utilities for memory management and retrieval."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
=======
[project]
name = "langmem"
version = "0.0.7rc1"
description = "Prebuilt utilities for memory management and retrieval."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
license = "MIT"
dynamic = ["version"]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change:
1. Adds explicit license field
2. Adds dynamic version handling to ensure metadata version compatibility

After applying these changes, try rebuilding and uploading the package:

```bash
python -m build
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

If you need to specify a license file, we should also add a LICENSE file to your repository. Let me know if you'd like help with that.

#### write a bash one-liner to find docs -name "*.md" and then pbcopy the contents with the relative path at the top of each doc  

Here's a command that will find all .md files in the docs directory, prepend each file's relative path, and copy the combined output to the clipboard:

```bash
find docs -name "*.md" -type f -exec sh -c 'echo "{}"; cat "{}"' \; | pbcopy
```

This will:
1. Find all .md files in docs directory
2. For each file, print its path followed by its contents
3. Copy the entire output to clipboard via pbcopy
