**ADVISORY: WebbPSF IS BEING MIGRATED TO A NEW REPOSITORY: STPSF (Space Telescope PSF)**

   **To reflect its broader support for Roman as well as James Webb, WebbPSF is being migrated to a new repository: STPSF (Space Telescope PSF).**
   **This transition is being done in such a way as to maintain back-compatibility for existing code, and existing installations will continue to run as-is.**
   **This transitional period is ongoing now. Please do not submit pull requests to this webbpsf repo at this time.**
   **The STPSF github repository will soon be available for use instead.**

WebbPSF produces simulated PSFs for the James Webb Space Telescope, NASA's
flagship infrared space telescope. WebbPSF can simulate images for any of the
four science instruments plus the fine guidance sensor, including both direct
imaging, coronagraphic, and spectroscopic modes.

WebbPSF also supports simulating PSFs for the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly WFIRST),
including its Wide Field Instrument and a preliminary version of the Coronagraph Instrument.

.. note::

   The current Roman WFI optical model was provided by Goddard Space Flight Center circa 2021 (the Cycle 9 reference data); a new optical model is currently being implemented in WebbPSF.

Developed by Marshall Perrin, Joseph Long, Shannon Osborne, Robel Geda, Bradley Sappington, Marcio MelÃ©ndez,
Charles-Philippe Lajoie, Jarron Leisenring, Neil Zimmerman, Keira Brooks,
Justin Otor, Trey Kulp, Lauren Chambers, Alden Jurling, and collaborators, 2010-2024.

Documentation can be found online at https://webbpsf.readthedocs.io

WebbPSF requires input data for its simulations, including optical path
difference (OPD) maps, filter transmission curves, and coronagraph Lyot mask
shapes. These data files are not included in this source distribution.
Please see the documentation to download the required data files.
