# srswti text analysis & processing toolkit

## overview
this documentation describes our powerful text analysis system, featuring advanced syntactic understanding and sentiment analysis capabilities. the toolkit combines sophisticated grammar parsing with emotional intelligence, complemented by nltk and spacy integrations for comprehensive nlp processing.

## theoretical foundations

### syntactic analysis framework

#### grammar parsing model
formal grammar structure:
```
NP → (DT|PP$)? JJ* (NN|NNS)    # captures noun phrases
VP → VB.* (NP|PP)              # identifies actions
PP → IN NP                     # handles relationships
ADJP → JJ.*                    # extracts properties
```

theoretical advantages:
- hierarchical decomposition
- compositional semantics
- recursive pattern recognition
- contextual understanding

#### sentiment vector space
sentiment computation:
$S(text) = (s_{pos}, s_{neg}, s_{neu}, s_{compound})$

aggregation model:
$S_{overall} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n S(sentence_i)$

properties:
- multi-dimensional scoring
- normalized aggregation
- temporal sentiment flow
- emotional trajectory tracking

### entity recognition system

#### entity extraction framework
```python
@dataclass
class EntityInfo:
    text: str          # surface form
    label: str         # entity type
    confidence: float  # detection score
    position: tuple    # text position
```

extraction process:
$E(text) = \text{ne_chunk}(\text{pos_tag}(tokens))$

operational features:
- confidence scoring
- position tracking
- type classification
- hierarchical chunking

""")
```

### advanced processing
```python
analysis = analyzer.analyze_text(text)
enhanced_data = {
    'structure': analysis['structure'],
