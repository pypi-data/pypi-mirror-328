# zero-shot classification with srswti half-billion parameter transformer model

## overview
this documentation describes our innovative zero-shot classification system leveraging bart-inspired transformer architecture with ~500m parameters, enabling flexible text classification across domains without task-specific fine-tuning.

## initial problem analysis

### traditional approaches

**large language models (llms):**
- powerful but expensive
- require billions/trillions of parameters
- high latency (2.5s-7s per inference)
- costly compute and api calls
- heavy memory footprint
- as if your using a hammer since eveyrthing is a nail for you

## our solution: entailment score transformation

#### raw logits to probabilities

probability transformation:

$p(y|x) = \frac{\exp(f_{\theta}(x,y))}{\sum\exp(f_{\theta}(x,y'))}$

where:
- $f_{\theta}$: model's entailment function
- $x$: input text
- $y$: candidate label
- $y'$: all possible labels

#### multi-label probability space

**independent binary decisions:**

$p(y_i|x) = \sigma(z_i) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-z_i)}$

where:
- $z_i$: logit for label $i$
- $\sigma$: sigmoid function

**theoretical advantages:**
- preserves independence
- maintains calibration
- handles overlapping concepts

**probability interpretation:**
- each $p(y_i|x)$ is independent
- no competition between labels
- natural for "fluid" categories

#### single-label transformation

**competitive normalization:**

$p(y_i|x) = \frac{\exp(z_i)}{\sum\exp(z_j)}$

**mathematical properties:**
- maximum entropy principle
- maintains relative odds
- creates proper distribution

**probability interpretation:**
- forces competition
- preserves rank order
- maintains calibration
## theoretical foundations

### probability framework
our system reimagines classification through sophisticated probability transformations:

#### core probability calculation
```
p(label|text) = softmax(logits)[entailment_index]
```
where:
- logits: raw model outputs
- entailment_index: position corresponding to entailment prediction
- probability space: [0,1] for each label

#### multi-label scenario
transformation: $p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$
key properties:
- independent probability space per label
- preserves natural label overlaps
- maintains calibrated confidence
- allows multiple high-probability predictions

mathematical justification:
- sigmoid transformation maintains independence
- no forced competition between labels
- natural handling of overlapping concepts
- preserves relative confidence levels

#### single-label scenario
transformation: $p_i = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum e^{x_j}}$
key properties:
- enforces probability distribution
- creates natural competition
- maintains relative rankings
- implements maximum entropy principle

optimization features:
- temperature scaling: $p(y|x) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{z}{t}\right)$
- confidence calibration
- distribution sharpness control
### sequence pair architecture

#### premise-hypothesis framework
structure:
- premise: full input context
- hypothesis: templated label claim
- relationship: entailment â†’ classification

template design:
```python
hypothesis = f"this text is about {label}."
```

theoretical advantages:
- domain-agnostic application
- consistent probability space
- minimal bias introduction
- clear semantic mapping

#### pair processing dynamics
operational principles:
1. independent evaluation
2. controlled context preservation
3. normalized competition
4. calibrated confidence scoring

### efficiency breakthroughs


#### optimization strategies to summarize

#### probability calibration 
$p(y|x) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{z}{t}\right)$ 
where:
fine-tuning parameters:
- temperature (t): controls distribution sharpness
- threshold: minimum confidence cutoff
- calibration: maintains probability accuracy

#### normalization effects
handling considerations:
- score compression/expansion
- extreme value management
- relative relationship preservation

#### template engineering
optimization factors:
- phrasing impact
- context window usage
- semantic distance control
