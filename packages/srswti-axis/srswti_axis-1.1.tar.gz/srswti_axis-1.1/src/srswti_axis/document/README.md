# srswti divergence approach

## theoretical foundations

### traditional jsd
the jensen-shannon divergence (jsd) is a method of measuring the similarity between two probability distributions. it is a symmetric and smoothed version of the kullback-leibler divergence, which is not symmetric and can be undefined if one distribution assigns zero probability to an event that the other distribution considers possible. jsd is bounded between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates identical distributions and 1 indicates maximum divergence. the classical formulation of jsd is given by:
$jsd(p||q) = \frac{1}{2}d_{kl}(p||m) + \frac{1}{2}d_{kl}(q||m)$
where m is the average of the two distributions, $m = \frac{1}{2}(p + q)$. this formulation ensures that jsd is always defined and provides a meaningful measure of divergence even when the distributions have zero probabilities.
where M is mixture:
$M = \frac{1}{2}(P + Q)$

properties:
- symmetric metric
- bounded [0,1]
- square root of jsd is metric
- handles zero probabilities

### our enhanced approach

#### semantic space mapping
text to distribution:
```
1. embed text → R^d
2. project to semantic anchors
3. create probability distribution
4. stabilize numerically
```

enhanced formula:
$JSD_{enhanced} = \sqrt{\min(1.0, \max(0.0, JSD_{raw}))}$

#### numerical stabilization
safe kl computation:
```python
def safe_kl(x, y):
    valid_mask = x > eps
    safe_x = x[valid_mask]
    safe_y = y[valid_mask]
    return np.sum(safe_x * (np.log2(safe_x) - np.log2(safe_y)))
```

advantages:
- handles zero probabilities
- maintains stability
- preserves metric properties
- efficient computation, lol

### semantic distribution creation

#### anchor projection
process:
1. create semantic anchors:
```python
anchors = normalized_random_matrix(K, d)
```

2. compute similarities:
$sim(x, anchors) = \frac{x \cdot anchors}{||x|| \, ||anchors||}$

3. create distribution:
$P(x) = \text{softmax}(\frac{sim(x, anchors)}{T})$

#### complexity weighting
dynamic weights:
$w_{cos} = 0.7 - 0.2C - 0.1D$

where:
- C: text complexity
- D: semantic difference
- bounded [0.4, 0.8]

## practical improvements

### numerical stability
1. eps handling:
```python
p = np.maximum(p, 1e-10)
p = p / np.sum(p)
```

2. log computation:
```python
safe_log = np.log2(x + eps)
```

3. bounded output:
```python
score = np.clip(score, 0.0, 1.0)
```

### performance optimization
techniques:
- cached embeddings
- batch processing
- sparse computations
- early stopping

## example comparison

### similar texts
```
text1: "cats are adorable pets"
text2: "felines make charming companions"

score: ~0.15 (low divergence)
```

### different texts
```
text1: "cats are adorable pets"
text2: "quantum physics theories"

score: ~0.85 (high divergence)
```

## advantages over traditional jsd

1. semantic awareness:
- handles synonyms
- context sensitive
- meaning preservation

2. stability:
- guaranteed convergence
- bounded outputs
- handles edge cases

3. efficiency:
- o(n) complexity
- parallel computation
- cached operations

## conclusion
our enhanced jsd approach combines theoretical soundness with practical improvements for robust semantic divergence measurement.

Future improvements:
- cross-lingual support
- domain adaptation
- incremental updates
- distributed processing
