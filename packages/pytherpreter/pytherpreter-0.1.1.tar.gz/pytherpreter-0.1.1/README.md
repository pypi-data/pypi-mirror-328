# üêç pytherpreter üêç

A Python interpreter with built-in safeguards for executing untrusted code, like LLM-generated scripts.

This repository contains the Python interpreter tool extracted from HuggingFace‚Äôs [_smolagents_](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) project.
Big hug to the HuggingFace team for their initial implementation! ü§ó

Some improvements over smolagents:
- Supports async code execution using the `async_evaluate` function and `AsyncPythonInterpreter` class.
- Improved function call resolution.
- Supports custom subscriptable objects.
- No external dependencies.

## Installation
```shell
pip install pytherpreter
```

Latest development version:

```shell
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/aremeis/pytherpreter.git
```

or

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/aremeis/pytherpreter.git
```

## Usage

### Using `evaluate`

This function evaluates Python code and returns the result.
```python
from pytherpreter import evaluate

result, final_answer = evaluate("""
from math import sqrt
sqrt(4)
""")
print(result)
print(final_answer)

# Output:
# 2.0
# False
```

By default, the `evaluate` function will return the result of the last expression in the code.
However, you can also return a value from the code by using the `final_answer` function:

```python
result, final_answer = evaluate_python_code("""
from math import sqrt
final_answer(sqrt(4))
""")
print(result)
print(final_answer)

# Output:
# 2.0
# True
```

### Using `PythonInterpreter`

This class is a wrapper around the `evaluate` function that keeps the state of the interpreter between calls.
Variables and functions defined by the code will be be available in subsequent calls.

```python
from pytherpreter import PythonInterpreter

interpreter = PythonInterpreter()
result, logs, is_final_answer = interpreter("x = 3")
print(result)
print(logs)
print(is_final_answer)

# Output:
# 3
# 
# False

result, logs, is_final_answer = interpreter("""
x += 1
print('x =', x)
final_answer(x);
""")
print(result)
print(logs)
print(is_final_answer)

# Output:
# 4
# x = 4
# True
```
