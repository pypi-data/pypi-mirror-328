# pytherpreter
A Python interpreter with built-in safeguards for executing untrusted code, like LLM-generated scripts.

This repository extracts the Python interpreter tool from HuggingFaceâ€™s [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) project.

## Installation
```shell
pip install pytherpreter
```

## Usage

### `evaluate_python_code`

`evaluate_python_code` is a function that evaluates Python code and returns the result.
```python
from pytherpreter import evaluate_python_code

result, final_answer = evaluate_python_code("""
from math import sqrt
sqrt(4)
""")
print(result)
print(final_answer)

# Output:
# 2.0
# False
```

By default, the `evaluate_python_code` function will return the result of the last expression in the code.
However, you can also return a value from the code by using the `final_answer` function:

```python
result, _ = evaluate_python_code("""
from math import sqrt
final_answer(sqrt(4))
""")
print(result)
print(result)
print(final_answer)

# Output:
# 2.0
# True
```
