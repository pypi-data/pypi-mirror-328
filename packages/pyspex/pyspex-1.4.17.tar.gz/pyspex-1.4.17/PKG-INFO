Python package `pyspex` contains software to access SPEXone data.
This package contains software scripts and classes to:
* Read data in CCSDS format from the SPEXone instrument and write the data in Level-1A format.
* Read Level-0 data from the SPEXone after integration on the PACE platform and write the data in Level-1A in-flight science and calibration products.
* Read SPEXone CKD product
* Read in-flight PACE engineering and housekeeping (HKT) products.
* Handle SPEXone binning tables (read, write, visualize).
