    # Fetch categories
    categories = await client.get_categories()
    for category in categories:
        print(f"Category: {category.name}")

    # Fetch tournaments by category
    tournaments = await client.get_tournaments_by_category(categories[0])

        print(f"Tournament: {tournament.name}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Get event data

```python
import asyncio
from aiosofascore import BaseSoccerApi


async def main():
    
    client = BaseSoccerApi()
    event = await client.get_event(event_id='13363911')
