# jaxley-mech

A [Jaxley](https://github.com/mackelab/jaxley)-based library of ion channels and synapses for biophysical neuron models.

## Installation

`jaxley-mech` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/jaxley-mech/):

```bash
pip install jaxley-mech
```

or you can clone the repository and install it via `pip`'s "editable" mode:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jaxleyverse/jaxley-mech.git
pip install -e jaxley-mech
```

## Usage

See the [notebooks](notebooks) folder for usage examples.

First author last names and year abbreviations for the papers in which mechanism models 
are first described are used as the file names in cases where more than one mechanism is
included or multiple implementations exist. For single mechanisms, e.g. the ribbon synapse model, the file is simply 
named ribbon.py.

To view available mechanisms and filter them by species, cell type, reference, etc., it is possible to run the following code:
```python
import jaxley_mech as jm
print(jm.find_channel()) # shows metadata of the available channels
print(jm.find_channel(ion="K", species="rat")) # shows metadata of channels with these properties

all_synapses = jm.find_synapse()
print(all_synapses.reference) # shows the references of all synapses
```
