Today, under the EASE programme (Enhancement for Active Seniors), you can install fittings like ramps to help you get in and out of your homes. In toilets, you can install grab bars and make the floors slip-resistant for safety. Soon, seniors can choose from an expanded suite of fittings under EASE 2.0. For example, you can have foldable shower seats, you can have your toilet entrances widened, so that if you or your spouse needs a wheelchair, your wheelchair can be brought into the toilet, and life can be safer and much more convenient.'}}, {'Id': '733a4c01-b4d2-4827-9374-68c26b0cc777', 'ChunkHash': '8PxopDHFqmftm1f92xvNtC9_mQUVs6KtMsIIpqLKpf8', 'ChunkGroupId': '56bf2645-5fe6-44c8-a4b5-f11299ec72dc', 'ByteSize': 808, 'IsDuplicate': False, 'IsIndexed': False, 'Content': {'Id': '733a4c01-b4d2-4827-9374-68c26b0cc777', 'ChunkHash': '8PxopDHFqmftm1f92xvNtC9_mQUVs6KtMsIIpqLKpf8', 'ChunkGroupId': '56bf2645-5fe6-44c8-a4b5-f11299ec72dc', 'ByteSize': 808, 'IsDuplicate': False, 'IsIndexed': False, 'Content': 'The new framework of Standard, Plus, and Prime.

HDB is a vital part of the Singapore story. Right from the very start, the PAP Government put heavy emphasis on public housing.

Mr Lee was convinced that housing would give Singaporeans a stake in our nation’s future. Because, he explained, housing “gives more than a sensation of permanence; it is permanent…then we dig our toes in and we fight!” So, housing has always meant much more to us than a roof over our heads. It also gives every Singaporean a valuable asset and a powerful reason to fight for our country and our future. Fast forward 60 years, today we have one of the highest home ownership rates in the world. Nine in ten Singaporeans own our homes. Eight in ten live in HDB flats. Our Singaporean identity is deeply intertwined with our HDB flats and towns.
