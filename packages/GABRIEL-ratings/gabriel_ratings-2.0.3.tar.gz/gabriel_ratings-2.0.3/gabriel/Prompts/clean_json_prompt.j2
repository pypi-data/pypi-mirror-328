Consider the following output of a language model:

{{ dirty_json_output }}

Clean up the JSON output to ensure it is properly formatted. 

Output the cleaned, properly formatted JSON. 
If the JSON output is already properly formatted, return it as is. 
Pay meticulous attention to detail and ensure the JSON is correctly structured and free of any syntax errors.
Ensure no '```json' or similar markdown is included in the response.
Just the pure JSON output is required, properly formatted.
