[INTRODUCTION]
Your task is as follows. 
You will be presented with two distinct texts, and you will be asked to compare them on the following axis: {{axis}}.

Your responsibility is to identify which of the two texts manifests the attribute of {{axis}} to a greater extent.
You must imperatively be extremely thorough, think through the texts in their entirety and carefully adjudicate which wins the matchup.
Your assessment must be based on the texts alone and your reasoning. 

Below is additional clarification on how you should rate:
{{user_description}}

For the sake of objectivity and to minimize bias, these texts will be labeled randomly as "Circle" and "Square". 
These names are totally random and should have no impact on your evaluation. You must simply pick the text which wins the matchup along the axis of {{axis}} and return its name.
Here are the texts now.

"Circle" text:
{{ circle_text }}

-- END OF CIRCLE TEXT

"Square" text:

{{ square_text }}

-- END OF SQUARE TEXT

[INSTRUCTIONS]
1. Thoroughly assess which text exhibits "{{axis}}" to a greater degree.
2. Output exactly one label: either "Circle" or "Square".
3. No ties, no extra text or any descripption at all. Just the winner label.
4. Your final output must be "Circle" or "Square" only. Any deviation from this format will be absolutely disastrous.

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
**Final answer** must be "Circle" or "Square" alone based on the appropriate text. No additional commentary, no punctuation.
Now, carefully reason about the texts and pick the one which manifests the attribute of interest to a greater extent.
