This is a modernised version of the py-substrate-interface library, with the ability to use it asynchronously (as well as synchronously). It aims to be almost fully API-compatible with the original library.

In addition to it's async nature, it is additionally improved with using bt-decode rather than py-scale-codec for significantly faster SCALE decoding.
