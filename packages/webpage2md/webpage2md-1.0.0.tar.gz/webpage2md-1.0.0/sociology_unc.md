\*Though the Sociology Department uses the name Pauli Murray Hall for
our building, on official maps you will find it as Hamilton Hall. In
July 2020, all of the departments housed in the building agreed to adopt
the name Pauli Murray Hall because of Professor Hamilton's role in
shaping history for the benefit of white supremacy and Murray's legacy
of advocacy for the rights of all members of society. An official
request with the Chancellor is pending. For more information, please see
[here.](https://sociology.unc.edu/pauli-murray-hall/)
