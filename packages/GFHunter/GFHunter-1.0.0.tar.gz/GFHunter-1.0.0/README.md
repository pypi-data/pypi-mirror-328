- **GFHunter** is a long read sequence transcriptome alignment-based fusion genes detection tool.
- **Indexing**: User can download the prepared index folder based on **GENCODE release 44** here or create a new index by GFHunter **index** function.
- **Detection**: GFHunter detects fusions in **long read RNA-seq data**, user just need **index folder** and **long read data** under detection.
- Benchmark evaluations position GFHunter as redefining the analytical frontiers of gene fusion detection:
  1. **Lowest false-positive fusion rates** in non-tumor data.
  2. Achieves a **substantially higher F1-score** in real cancer cell lines evaluation.
  3. Operates **many times faster** and requires **fewer and stable memory** than other tools.
