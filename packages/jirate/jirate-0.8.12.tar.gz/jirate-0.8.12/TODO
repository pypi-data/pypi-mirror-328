General:

Rewrite - getting spaghetti-ish with too many exceptions/value checks
          mixed together

Man pages

Unit tests :P

JIRA:
- pagniation
- searching/listing with component(s)?
- sorting by column in ls/search output
- Editing components / other component fields
- Date/Datetime processing on input: right now, it's just a string.
  e.g. 23-Oct-2023, 2023-Oct-23, 2023-10-23 should all work for dates,
  for example
- All table outputs should have configurable field widths
- All table outputs should be able to avoid truncating to the width
  of the terminal

Attachments
- add File attachments
