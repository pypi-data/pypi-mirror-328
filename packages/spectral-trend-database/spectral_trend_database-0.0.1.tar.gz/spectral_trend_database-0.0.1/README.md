#  SPECTRAL TREND DATABASE

DSEâ€™s Spectral Trends Database monitors uses data from NASA's Landsat satellites to track over 14,000 points in corn and soy fields in the midwestern United States. The database contains daily values for 36 different vegetation indices from the year 2000 to present, along with a number of derivative metrics that are useful for detecting crop planting and harvesting. The data will be useful for myriad agriculture applications, including the study and monitoring of yield, yield-stability, soil
health, cover-cropping, and other sustainable agricultural practices.

## DATABASE DESCRIPTION

The _Spectral Trend Database_ lives on [Google Big Query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs) and can be accessed directly using big query.  However, we've built a number of python tools to make accessing the data eaiser ([docs](XXX), [example](XXX)). The database tables are listed in the table below.  Detailed descriptions of the indvidual tables can be found in our api-docs ([here](https://schmidtdse.github.io/spectral_trend_database/docs/pages/database.html)).


| Table | Keys | Dates | Daily | Description |
| ---: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :---- |
|  [SAMPLE_POINTS](https://schmidtdse.github.io/spectral_trend_database/docs/pages/database.html#sample_points) | sample_id | False | False | location information such as lat, lon and geohashes |
|  [ADMINISTRATIVE_BOUNDARIES](https://schmidtdse.github.io/spectral_trend_database/docs/pages/database.html#admin_boundaries) | sample_id | False | False | administrative information such as state and county |
|  [QDANN_YIELD](https://schmidtdse.github.io/spectral_trend_database/docs/pages/database.html#qdann_yield) | sample_id, year | True | False | yield estimations for year |
|  [LANDSAT_RAW_MASKED](https://schmidtdse.github.io/spectral_trend_database/docs/pages/database.html#masked_landsat) | sample_id, year | True | False | masked landsat band values for year |
|  [RAW_INDICES_V1](https://schmidtdse.github.io/spectral_trend_database/docs/pages/database.html#raw_indices) | sample_id, year | True | False | spectral indices built from `LANDSAT_RAW_MASKED`|
|  [SMOOTHED_INDICES_V1](https://schmidtdse.github.io/spectral_trend_database/docs/pages/database.html#indices) | sample_id, year | True | True | interpolated and smoothed daily values for indices contained in `RAW_INDICES_V1` |
|  [MACD_INDICES_V1](https://schmidtdse.github.io/spectral_trend_database/docs/pages/database.html#macd) | sample_id, year | True | True |  additional indices dervived from `SMOOTHED_INDICES_V1` whose values are useful for detecting cover-croping and green-up dates |
|  [INDICES_STATS_V1](https://schmidtdse.github.io/spectral_trend_database/docs/pages/database.html#indices_stats) | sample_id, year | True | False | statistical (min, max, mean, median, skew, kurtosis) aggregation of `SMOOTHED_INDICES_V1` |
|  [INDICES_STATS_V1_GROWING_SEASON](https://schmidtdse.github.io/spectral_trend_database/docs/pages/database.html#indices_stats) | sample_id, year | True | False | same as `INDICES_STATS_V1` but restricted to the "growing season" |
|  [INDICES_STATS_V1_OFF_SEASON](https://schmidtdse.github.io/spectral_trend_database/docs/pages/database.html#indices_stats) | sample_id, year | True | False | same as `INDICES_STATS_V1` but restricted to the "off season"|

## INSTALL/REQUIREMENTS

1. Clone Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/spectral_trend_database.git
```

2. Requirements

Requirements are managed through a [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest) "project" (similar to a conda environment). After pixi is installed use `pixi run <cmd>` to ensure the correct project is being used. For example,

```bash
# lauch jupyter
pixi run jupyter lab .

# run a script
pixi run python scripts/hello_world.py
```

The first time `pixi run` is executed the project will be installed (note this means the first run will be a bit slower). Any changes to the project will be updated on the subsequent `pixi run`.  It is unnecessary, but you can run `pixi install` after changes - this will update your local environment, so that it does not need to be updated on the next `pixi run`.

Note, the repo's `pyproject.toml`, and `pixi.lock` files ensure `pixi run` will just work. No need to recreate an environment. Additionally, the `pyproject.toml` file includes `fire_risk = { path = ".", editable = true }`. This line is equivalent to `pip install -e .`, so there is no need to pip install this module.

The project was initially created using a `package_names.txt` and the following steps. Note that this should **NOT** be re-run as it will create a new project (potentially changing package versions).

```bash
#
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT run this unless you explicity want to create a new pixi project
#
# 1. initialize pixi project (in this case the pyproject.toml file had already existed)
pixi init . --format pyproject
# 2. add specified python version
pixi add python=3.11
# 3. add packages (note this will use pixi magic to determine/fix package version ranges)
pixi add $(cat package_names.txt)
pixi add --pypi $(cat pypi_package_names.txt)
```

Note that pixi is being used to install build/twine are part of the pixi-project so pushing to PYPI requires `pixi run`

```bash
pixi run python -m build
pixi run python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```
