    This class contains unit tests for the `api.find_inputs()` function, which is used
    to extract input variables from a given script. The tests cover various scenarios,
    including syntax errors, arithmetic operations, function calls, variable references,
    string handling, and multiple statements. The class also includes tests for the worker
    functionality, which mocks the polyscript subscribe and publish operations.
