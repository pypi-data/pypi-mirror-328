This is a work in progress. And some of this article is just an outline for now.

Thresholds enable you to signal failure at different severity levels. In the near future, thresholds
will be able to trigger custom actions. For example, when testing a column for Null/missing values
with `col_vals_not_null()` you might want to warn on any missing values and stop where there are
10% missing values in the column.

```{python}
import pointblank as pb

validation_1 = (
    pb.Validate(data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table"))
    .col_vals_not_null(columns="c", thresholds=(1, 0.1))
    .interrogate()
)

validation_1
```

The code uses `thresholds=(1, 0.1)` to set a `warn` threshold of `1` and a `stop` threshold of `0.1`
(which is 10%) failing test units. Notice these pieces in the validation table:

- The `FAIL` column shows that 2 tests units have failed
- The `W` column (short for `warn`) shows a filled yellow circle indicating it's reached threshold
- The `S` column (`stop`) shows an open red circle indicating it's below threshold

The one final threshold, `N` (`notify`), wasn't set so appears on the validation table as a dash.

## Using the `Validation(threshold=)` Argument

We can also define thresholds globally. This means that every validation step will re-use the same
set of threshold values.

```python
import pointblank as pb

validation_2 = (
    pb.Validate(data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table"), thresholds=(1, 0.1))
    .col_vals_not_null(columns="a")
    .col_vals_gt(columns="b", value=2)
    .interrogate()
)

validation_2
```

In this, both the `col_vals_not_null()` and `col_vals_gt()` steps will use the `thresholds=` value
set in the `Validate()` call. Now, if you want to override these global threshold values for a given
validation step, you can always use the `threshold=` argument when calling a validation method (the
argument is present in every validation method).

## Ways to Define Thresholds


### Using a Tuple

The fastest way to define a threshold is to use a tuple with entries for `warn`, `stop`, and
`nofify` levels.

```python
# (warn, stop, notify)
threshold = (1, 2, 3)

Validate(data=..., threshold=threshold)
```

Note that a shorter tuple or even single values are also allowed:

- `(1, 2)`: `warn` state at 1 failing test unit, `stop` state at 2 failing test units
- `1` or `(1, )`: `warn` state at 1 failing test unit

### The `Threshold` Class


## Threshold Cutoff Values

Threshold values can be specified in two ways:

- percentage: a decimal value like 0.1 to mean 10% test units failed
- number: a fixed number of test units failed

Threshold cutoffs are inclusive so any value of failing test units greater than or equal to the
cutoff will result in triggering the threshold. So if a threshold is defined with a cutoff value of
`5`, then 5 failing test units will result in threshold.

## Triggering Actions

This is not currently implemented.


## Use Case: Stopping on any Failures


## Use Case: Global tolerance bands
