# ADPA Framework Development Guidelines

## Code Structure and Organization

### File Organization
- Maximum file length: 500 lines
- Feature-based directory structure
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Single responsibility principle for modules

### Function and Class Guidelines
- Maximum function length: 50 lines
- Maximum class length: 200 lines
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Maximum cyclomatic complexity: 10

### Naming Conventions
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `UserManager`)
- Functions: snake_case (e.g., `process_data`)
- Variables: snake_case (e.g., `user_count`)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`)
- Types: PascalCase (e.g., `UserType`)
- Private members: _prefix (e.g., `_internal_state`)
- Protected members: __prefix (e.g., `__protected_method`)
- Test functions: test_should_* (e.g., `test_should_process_valid_input`)
- Test fixtures: fixture_* (e.g., `fixture_valid_user`)
- Modules: lowercase_with_underscores (e.g., `data_processor.py`)

## Development Workflow

### 1. Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adpa.git
cd adpa

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

### 2. Making Changes

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following these guidelines:
   - Write tests first (TDD approach)
   - Follow code style guidelines
   - Keep changes focused and minimal
   - Add type hints to all functions
   - Document all public APIs

3. Run tests locally:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. Check code style:
   ```bash
   black adpa/
   isort adpa/
   mypy adpa/
   ```

### 3. Submitting Changes

1. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your descriptive commit message"
   ```

2. Push to your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Create a Pull Request on GitHub

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Test both success and error paths
- Use meaningful test names that describe behavior
- Keep tests independent and isolated

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Use test databases for database tests
- Mock external services
- Test API endpoints thoroughly
- Verify error handling and edge cases

### Performance Tests
- Test under expected load
- Measure response times
- Monitor resource usage
- Test concurrent operations
- Verify scalability

## Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Document all public APIs
- Include type hints
- Provide usage examples
- Document exceptions and edge cases

### Project Documentation
- Keep README.md up to date
- Document architecture decisions
- Provide setup instructions
- Include troubleshooting guide
- Document configuration options

## Version Control Guidelines

### Branches
- main: Production-ready code
- develop: Development branch
- feature/*: New features
- bugfix/*: Bug fixes
- release/*: Release preparation

### Commits
- Use conventional commits format
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Reference issues in commits

### Pull Requests
- Provide clear description
- Include test results
- Link related issues
- Request appropriate reviewers
- Keep changes focused

## Release Process

### 1. Preparation
- Update version numbers
- Update CHANGELOG.md
- Update documentation
- Run full test suite
- Check dependencies

### 2. Testing
- Run integration tests
- Perform manual testing
- Check performance metrics
- Verify documentation

### 3. Release
- Create release branch
- Tag release version
- Update production branch
- Deploy to production
- Monitor for issues

## Security Guidelines

### Code Security
- No hardcoded secrets
- Use environment variables
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize outputs
- Handle errors securely

### Data Security
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Use secure protocols
- Implement access control
- Log security events
- Regular security audits

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Metrics

- Monitor error rates
- Track resource usage
- Set up alerts

### Logging
- Use structured logging
- Include context in logs
- Log appropriate levels
- Rotate logs regularly
- Monitor log storage

### Maintenance
- Regular dependency updates
- Security patches
- Performance optimization
- Code cleanup
- Documentation updates
