# Integration Workflow

The ADPA framework provides a robust integration system for connecting with external services and data sources.

## Overview

The integration workflow involves several components:
- Integration Manager
- API Gateway
- Data Transformer
- Security Manager
- Adapter Registry
- External Services

## Components

### Integration Manager
- Manages service integrations
- Handles registration process
- Monitors service health
- Coordinates updates

### API Gateway
- Routes requests
- Manages endpoints
- Handles authentication
- Controls traffic

### Data Transformer
- Converts data formats
- Validates schemas
- Handles type conversion
- Ensures data quality

### Security Manager
- Manages credentials
- Controls access
- Verifies permissions
- Protects resources

### Adapter Registry
- Stores service configurations
- Tracks service status
- Manages service metadata
- Provides service discovery

## Integration Process

1. Service Registration
   - Validate service details
   - Check credentials
   - Configure endpoints
   - Set up monitoring

2. Data Integration
   - Route requests
   - Transform data
   - Validate formats
   - Store results

3. Service Monitoring
   - Check health status
   - Monitor connections
   - Track performance
   - Alert on issues

4. Service Updates
   - Update configurations
   - Modify routes
   - Refresh credentials
   - Test changes

## Best Practices

1. Service Management
