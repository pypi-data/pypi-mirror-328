# Performance Workflow

The ADPA framework implements a comprehensive performance management system for monitoring, optimization, and scaling.

## Overview

The performance workflow involves several components:
- Performance Manager
- Query Optimizer
- Cache Manager
- Resource Monitor
- Load Balancer
- Metrics Collector

## Components

### Performance Manager
- Coordinates performance operations
- Manages resource utilization
- Handles optimization
- Controls scaling

### Query Optimizer
- Optimizes query execution
- Generates execution plans
- Estimates query costs
- Improves performance

### Cache Manager
- Manages query cache
- Implements caching strategy
- Handles invalidation
- Improves response time

### Resource Monitor
- Monitors system resources
- Tracks utilization
- Detects bottlenecks
- Triggers alerts

### Load Balancer
- Distributes workload
- Manages scaling
- Routes requests
- Optimizes resources

### Metrics Collector
- Collects performance data
- Analyzes trends
- Stores metrics
- Generates reports

1. Performance Monitoring
   - Resource monitoring
   - Metrics collection
   - Load balancing
   - Alert generation

2. Query Optimization
   - Cache checking
   - Plan generation
   - Cost estimation
   - Result caching

3. Resource Scaling
   - Load monitoring
   - Instance scaling
   - Route updating
   - Metrics recording

4. Performance Tuning
   - Trend analysis
   - Rule updates
   - Route optimization
   - Cache strategy

## Best Practices
