# Distribution Workflow

The ADPA framework implements a comprehensive distribution system for packaging, testing, and deployment.

## Overview

The distribution workflow involves several components:
- Build System
- Test Runner
- Linter
- Type Checker
- Security Scanner
- Package Manager
- CI/CD Pipeline

## Components

### Build System
- Coordinates build process
- Manages dependencies
- Handles packaging
- Controls distribution

### Test Runner
- Executes tests
- Checks coverage
- Validates functionality
- Ensures quality

### Linter
- Checks code style
- Enforces standards
- Formats code
- Maintains consistency

### Type Checker
- Validates types
- Checks imports
- Ensures type safety
- Prevents errors

### Security Scanner
- Scans dependencies
- Checks for vulnerabilities
- Verifies licenses
- Ensures security

### Package Manager
- Builds packages
- Manages distribution
- Handles installation
- Verifies setup

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automates builds
- Manages deployment
- Updates documentation
- Ensures quality

## Distribution Processes

1. Build Preparation
   - Code linting
   - Type checking
   - Test execution
   - Security scanning

2. Package Distribution
   - Package building
   - PyPI upload
   - Documentation update
   - Release verification

3. Package Installation
   - Package download
   - Dependency installation
   - Setup verification
   - Test execution

4. Documentation Update
   - Documentation build
   - API generation
   - Site deployment
   - Quality checks

## Best Practices

1. Build Process
   - Clean builds
   - Version control
   - Dependency management
   - Quality checks

2. Testing Strategy
   - Comprehensive tests
   - Coverage requirements
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing

3. Security Measures
   - Dependency scanning
   - Code analysis
   - License checking
   - Vulnerability detection

4. Documentation
   - API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Release notes
   - Installation guides

5. Deployment
   - Automated releases
   - Version control
   - Release verification
   - Rollback procedures
