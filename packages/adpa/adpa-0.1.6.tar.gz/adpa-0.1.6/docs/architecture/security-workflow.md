# Security Workflow

The ADPA framework implements a comprehensive security system that ensures data protection, access control, and audit logging.

## Overview

The security workflow involves several components:
- Security Manager
- Auth Provider
- Token Manager
- Access Control
- Encryption Manager
- Audit Logger

## Components

### Security Manager
- Coordinates security operations
- Manages authentication
- Controls authorization
- Handles encryption

### Auth Provider
- Verifies credentials
- Manages MFA
- Validates services
- Handles authentication

### Token Manager
- Generates tokens
- Validates tokens
- Manages expiry
- Handles revocation

### Access Control
- Manages permissions
- Enforces policies
- Controls access
- Updates rules

### Encryption Manager
- Handles encryption
- Manages keys
- Protects data
- Ensures security

### Audit Logger
- Records events
- Monitors security
- Analyzes patterns
- Generates reports

## Security Processes

1. Authentication
   - Credential verification
   - MFA validation
   - Token generation
   - Event logging

2. Authorization
   - Token validation
   - Permission checking
   - Access control
   - Audit logging

3. Data Protection
   - Data encryption
   - Key management
   - Secure storage
   - Event recording

4. Security Monitoring
   - Log analysis
   - Pattern detection
   - Rule updates
   - Alert generation

5. External Integration
   - Service verification
   - Permission checking
   - Secure communication
   - Event logging

## Best Practices

1. Authentication
   - Strong passwords
   - MFA enforcement
   - Token management
   - Session control

2. Authorization
   - Least privilege
   - Role-based access
   - Policy enforcement
   - Regular reviews

3. Encryption
   - Strong algorithms
   - Key rotation
   - Secure storage
   - Data protection

4. Monitoring
   - Real-time alerts
   - Pattern analysis
   - Incident response
   - Regular audits

5. Integration
   - Service validation
   - Secure channels
   - Access control
   - Event tracking
