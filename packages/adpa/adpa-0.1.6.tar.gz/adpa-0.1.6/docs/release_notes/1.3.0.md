### 6. Enhanced Configuration Management
- Added comprehensive Pydantic-based configuration validation system
- Introduced structured environment variable management
- Added validation for database URIs and API configurations
- Improved error handling and reporting for configuration issues


## Breaking Changes


### 1. Configuration

- New configuration structure using Pydantic models
- Changed default timeout values
- Updated security settings
- Environment variable structure has been updated
- Configuration validation is now mandatory
- Database URI format is strictly enforced


### 2. API Changes

- Updated method signatures for async support
- New return types with additional metadata
- Changed error handling approach


## Migration Guide


### 1. Configuration Updates

```python
# Old configuration
config = {
    "timeout": 30,
    "security": True
}

# New configuration
from adpa.text2sql.hybrid.coordinator import CoordinatorConfig

config = CoordinatorConfig(
    connection_params={"url": "sqlite:///db.sqlite"},
    enable_security=True,
    enable_monitoring=True,
    optimization_level=2,
    timeout_seconds=30
)
```

### 2. API Migration

```python
# Old usage
engine = TextToSQLEngine(config)
result = engine.convert(text)

# New usage
engine = TextToSQLEngine(config)
result = await engine.convert_to_sql(text)
print(f"SQL: {result.sql}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence}")
print(f"Processing time: {result.processing_time}s")
```

### 3. Configuration Migration

1. Update your `.env` file structure using the new `.env.template`
2. Validate your configuration using the new validation system
3. Update any custom configuration handling to use the new models
4. Review and update database connection strings


## Future Plans


### 1. Performance

- Further optimization of query processing
- Enhanced caching mechanisms
- Improved resource utilization


### 2. Features

- Additional agent types
- Extended security features
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities


### 3. Integration

- Support for more database types
- Additional LLM providers
- Enhanced cloud integration
