# Testing Strategy

Version 0.7.0

## Overview
ADPA follows a comprehensive test-driven development (TDD) approach to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Located in `tests/test_agents/`, `tests/test_teams/`, etc.
- Use pytest fixtures for setup
- Mock external dependencies

Example:
```python
def test_research_agent_search():
    """Test research agent search functionality."""
    agent = ResearchAgent()
    result = agent.tavily_search("test query")
    assert isinstance(result, str)
    assert "# Latest News Report" in result
```

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Located in `tests/test_integration/`
- Focus on API interactions and data flow
- Test real-world scenarios

Example:
```python
def test_research_team_workflow():
    """Test complete research workflow."""
    team = ResearchTeam()
    task = "Latest OpenAI news"
    result = team.process_task(task)
    assert team.researcher.last_task == task
    assert isinstance(result, str)
```

### 3. UI Tests
- Test Streamlit interface
- Located in `tests/test_ui/`
- Verify component rendering
- Test user interactions

Example:
```python
def test_home_page_render():
    """Test home page rendering."""
    result = render_home_page()
    assert "Welcome to ADPA" in result
    assert "Test Status" in result
```

### 4. End-to-End Tests
- Test complete workflows
- Located in `tests/test_e2e/`
- Verify system integration
- Test real user scenarios

Example:
```python
def test_research_workflow():
    """Test end-to-end research workflow."""
    # Setup
    app = ADPAApp()
    team = app.get_team("research")
    
    # Execute
    result = team.execute_task("Latest AI news")
    
    # Verify
    assert result.status == "completed"
    assert result.output is not None
```

## Test Coverage Goals
- Unit Tests: 90%+ coverage
- Integration Tests: 80%+ coverage
- UI Tests: 70%+ coverage
- Overall: 85%+ coverage

## Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=adpa tests/

# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=adpa --cov-report=html tests/
```

## CI/CD Integration
- Tests run on every pull request
- Coverage reports generated automatically
- Test results displayed in Streamlit UI
- Blocking merges on test failures
