## About

This package does 3 things: 
1) Automatic Speech Recognition: [**Ichigo-ASR**](#ichigo-asr)
2) Text to Speech: Coming Soon
3) Speech Language Model: [**Ichigo-LLM**](#ichigo-llm) (experimental)

It contains only inference code, and caters to most local inference use cases around these three tasks.

## Installation

To get started, simply install the package.

```bash
pip install ichigo
```

## Ichigo-ASR

Ichigo-ASR is a compact (22M parameters), open-source speech tokenizer for the `Whisper-medium model`, designed to enhance performance on multilingual with minimal impact on its original English capabilities. Unlike models that output continuous embeddings, ·ªächigo-ASR compresses speech into discrete tokens, making it more compatible with large language models (LLMs) for immediate speech understanding. This speech tokenizer has been trained on over ~400 hours of English data and ~1000 hours of Vietnamese data.

### Batch Processing

The ichigo package can handle batch processing of audio files using a single line of code, with additional parameters for available for more control.

1. For single files

```python
# Quick one-liner for transcription
from ichigo.asr import transcribe
results = transcribe("path/to/your/file")
# Expected output: "{filename: transcription}"
```
A transcription.txt will also stored in the same folder as "path/to/your/file"

2. For multiple files (folder)

```python
# Quick one-liner for transcription
from ichigo.asr import transcribe
results = transcribe("path/to/your/folder")
# Expected output: "{filename1: transcription1, filename2: transcription2, ... filenameN: transcriptionN,}"
```
A subfolder will be created in `path/to/your/folder` and transcriptions will be stored as `filenameN.txt` in the subfolder.

### API

For integration with frontend, a python fastAPI is also available. This api also does batch processing. Streaming is currently not supported.

1. Start the server

```bash
# Uvicorn
cd api && uvicorn asr:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# or Docker 
docker compose up -d
```

2. curl
```bash
# S2T
curl "http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/transcriptions" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@sample.wav" -F "model=ichigo"

# S2R
curl "http://localhost:8000/s2r" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@sample.wav"

# R2T
curl "http://localhost:8000/r2t" -X POST \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"tokens":"<|sound_start|><|sound_1012|><|sound_1508|><|sound_1508|><|sound_0636|><|sound_1090|><|sound_0567|><|sound_0901|><|sound_0901|><|sound_1192|><|sound_1820|><|sound_0547|><|sound_1999|><|sound_0157|><|sound_0157|><|sound_1454|><|sound_1223|><|sound_1223|><|sound_1223|><|sound_1223|><|sound_1808|><|sound_1808|><|sound_1573|><|sound_0065|><|sound_1508|><|sound_1508|><|sound_1268|><|sound_0568|><|sound_1745|><|sound_1508|><|sound_0084|><|sound_1768|><|sound_0192|><|sound_1048|><|sound_0826|><|sound_0192|><|sound_0517|><|sound_0192|><|sound_0826|><|sound_0971|><|sound_1845|><|sound_1694|><|sound_1048|><|sound_0192|><|sound_1048|><|sound_1268|><|sound_end|>"}'
```

## Ichigo-LLM

:strawberry: Ichigo-LLM is an open, ongoing research experiment to extend a text-based LLM to have native "listening" ability. Think of it as an open data, open weight, on device Siri.

It uses an [early fusion](https://medium.com/@raj.pulapakura/multimodal-models-and-fusion-a-complete-guide-225ca91f6861#:~:text=3.3.,-Early%20Fusion&text=Early%20fusion%20refers%20to%20combining,fused%20representation%20through%20the%20model.) technique inspired by [Meta's Chameleon paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09818).

We ~~build~~ train in public:
- [Ichigo v0.3 Checkpoint Writeup](https://homebrew.ltd/blog/llama-learns-to-talk)
- [Ichigo v0.2 Checkpoint Writeup](https://homebrew.ltd/blog/llama3-just-got-ears)
- [Ichigo v0.1 Checkpoint Writeup](https://homebrew.ltd/blog/can-llama-3-listen)

## Ichigo-TTS

Coming Soon
  
## Join Us

:strawberry: Ichigo-LLM and üç∞ Ichigo-ASR is an open research project. We're looking for collaborators, and will likely move towards crowdsourcing speech datasets in the future.
