(Detailed documentation is coming soon...)

# Overview
**PyGRT**: An Efficient and Integrated Python Package for Computing Synthetic Seismograms in a Layered Half-Space Model. 

# Features

- **Dual-Language**:  
  To optimize performance, **PyGRT** uses **C** for its core computational tasks, while **Python** provides a user-friendly interface. Support **script style** and **command line style** to run the program.

- **Parallelization**:  
  Accelerated with **OpenMP** for parallel processing.

- **Integration**:  
  Built on the **Generalized Reflection-Transmission matrix Method (GRTM)** and the **Discrete Wavenumber Method (DWM)**, **PyGRT** integrates the **Peak-Trough Averaging Method (PTAM)** and **Filonâ€™s Integration Method (FIM)** to handle diverse source-receiver distributions. 

- **Modular Design**:   
  Clean and organized code structure, making it easy to extend and maintain.

# pre-requisite

1. [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) for python script style in virtual environment.
2. [FFTW](https://fftw.org/) for command line style.

# Installation

Two ways, choose one:
 
1. **PYPI** (recommend)  
  Run the following command in your virtual environment:
   ```Bash
   pip install -v pygrt-kit
   ```


2. Github 

   - Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Dengda98/PyGRT/releases), uncompress, and change the diretory.

   - Run the following command in your virtual environment:

      ```bash
      pip install -v .
      ```

If you're more comfortable with the command line style, run
   ```bash
   python -m pygrt.print
   ```
   you will see the directory path of executable file, and you can add it to `PATH` variable. For each command, use `-h` can see the help message.


# Usage Example

`example/` folder shows some examples in paper. **More examples are coming soon.**
