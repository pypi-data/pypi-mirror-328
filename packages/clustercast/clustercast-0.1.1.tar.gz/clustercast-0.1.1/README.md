# Overview

`clustercast` is a Python library for ML-based time series forecasting that supports both single-series (local) forecasting and multi-series (global) forecasting for grouped/hierarchical time series. The "cluster" in the name comes from the technique of modeling grouped (clustered) time series with shared traits concurrently. It provides two main forecasting approaches:

- **Direct Forecasting**: Trains separate models for each forecast step, using direct multi-step forecasting
- **Recursive Forecasting**: Trains a single model and uses its one-step-ahead predictions recursively for multi-step forecasting

Key features that differentiate `clustercast` from other libraries include:

- Support for grouped time series that share common categories using a global architecture
- Ability to perform stationarity tests for all time series simultaneously (ADF and KPSS)
- Differencing and Box-Cox transformations
- Automatic calculation of lag features
- Several types of seasonality features (Fourier, one-hot, and ordinal), which all support multiple seasonalities
- Sample weighting to emphasize recent observations
- Prediction intervals via Conformal Quantile Regression (with direct forecaster) or bootstrapped residuals (with recursive forecaster)
- Model-agnostic architecture supporting any custom ML model, with `LightGBM` as the default
- Ability to tune the hyperparameters of the built-in `LightGBM` model
- Handling of exogenous variables
- Support of missing data (for both individual features and entire timesteps)

Both forecasters share a similar API and handle data preprocessing automatically, making it easy to experiment with different forecasting approaches/parameters with minimal changes to code. The library is designed for flexibility and ease of use, allowing users to quickly implement sophisticated forecasting solutions while maintaining control over model parameters and preprocessing options.

## Installation

```bash
pip install clustercast
```

## Usage

The forecasting models in `clustercast` are simple to use, but come with many additional parameters allowing the user to implement sophisticated preprocessing techniques with ease. 
An example using the recursive forecasting class is shown below.
In this example, there are 12 distinct time series representing sales over time for different regions and product categories.

```python
# imports
from clustercast.datasets import load_store_sales
from clustercast import RecursiveForecaster

# load store sales data
data = load_store_sales()
print(data)
```

# make predictions out to 12 steps ahead
forecast = model.predict(steps=12)
print(forecast)

```
The output contains forecasts out to 12 months ahead for each of the 12 unique time series.
This is a fairly basic example implementation without much thought put into preprocessing or model tuning. 
This example can be easily extended and optimized using the built-in functionality in `clustercast`!
