# GCfit

## Equilibrium Globular Cluster Models and Fitting

`gcfit` is a Python package enabling the creation of multimass
distribution-function based lowered isothermal
([LIMEPY](https://github.com/mgieles/limepy)) models, representing globular
cluster (GC) systems, and the generalized fitting of these models to various
observational GC data products, via a parallelized sampling suite.
