Open the partner form and go to the `Sales & Purchases` tab. Add payment acquirers in the `Allowed Acquirers` field.

Note: Leaving this field empty will remove restrictions and allow the selection of any acquirer.

When the partner proceeds to checkout in the portal, only the allowed acquirers will be available for payment.

For not logged-in users, if you want to restrict their allowed acquirers, you need to edit the `Allowed Acquirers` field for the `Public user` partner (`base.public_user`).
