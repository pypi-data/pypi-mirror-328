# PyBibth√®que

Command line program to organize and manage a bibliography or references.

## Notes

Connects to mongodb database via a URI.
The details are in the config at `.config/bibtheque.toml`
Run tests with `pytest`


Still need to come up with a universal id system. I like doi and isbn but that doesn't work when a paper or book doesn't have that (like for a manual entry). I'm considering making a hash to id idea but I'm not sure if that's the best. I need to investigate particular hashes.

I need to implement the side of bibtheque that outputs bibtex strings to a bib file with correct ids for use in an article 

Fill out the argument parser help doc.

Integrate tags and notes in the cli.py

## running

`pip install -e <path>` to install and run

## bibtex

https://www.bibtex.com/format/

## setup

library
|- database.json
|- raw/
|- annotated/
|- .gitignore

### initialize

bibtheque init

- make library folder and folder structure
- make database.json
- make default config at .config/bibtheque.yml
- make .gitignore with raw/ and annotated/ in it


### insert files

insert files with `insert -f` ? (f flag for file?)

original filename is stored
file is renamed according to uuid given to it and moved
when entry is called, original file is returned (uuid.pdf renamed original.pdf)
