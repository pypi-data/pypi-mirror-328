    Represents a lane detected by Robobo, formed by two second degree polynomials.
    
    Attributes:
        - coeffs1 (dict): Dictionary with 'a','b' and 'c' (ax^2 + bx +c) coefficients of the left line.
        - coeffs2 (dict): Dictionary with 'a','b' and 'c' (ax^2 + bx +c) coefficients of the right line.
        - minv (array): Transformation matrix to get to the original perspective.
        - id (int): Sequence frame number. Since the camera starts, each frame has a number to be identified. Takes positive values.
