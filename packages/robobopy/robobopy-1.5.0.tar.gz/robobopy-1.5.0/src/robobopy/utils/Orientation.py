class Orientation:
    """
    Represents the orientation of the Smartphone.
    
    Attributes:
        - yaw (float): Rotation in degrees around the Z axis. Takes values between -180 and 180. The yaw angle turn is achieved by turning the base with the wheel motors and the PAN motor.
        - pitch (float): Rotation in degrees around the Y axis. Takes values between -180 and 180. The pitch angle turn is achieved by using the TILT motor or moving the robot through a frontally inclined plane.
        - roll (float): Rotation in degrees around the X axis. Takes values between -180 and 180. The turn in the roll angle cannot be achieved by Robobo, but if the surface on which it moves has a lateral inclination, it will change.
