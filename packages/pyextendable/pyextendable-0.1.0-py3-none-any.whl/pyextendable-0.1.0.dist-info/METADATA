        ### Statement of Purpose
        
        The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
        exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
        and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
        of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
        
        Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
        the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
        scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
        fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
        other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
        whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
        purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the
        ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural
        and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
        their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
        
        For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
        expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
        associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
        she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
        elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under
        its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in
        the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those
        rights.
        
        1.  **Copyright and Related Rights.** A Work made available under CC0
            may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights
            ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights
            include, but are not limited to, the following:
            
            i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
            communicate, and translate a Work;
            
            ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
            performer(s);
            
            iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
            likeness depicted in a Work;
            
            iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a
            Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
            
            v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
            data in a Work;
            
            vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC
            of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on
            the legal protection of databases, and under any national
            implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version
            of such directive); and
            
            vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout
            the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
            implementations thereof.
        
        2.  **Waiver.** To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in
            contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully,
            permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and
            surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and
            associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown
            (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action),
            in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
            duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
            extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any
            number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including
            without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes
            (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
            member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's
            heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be
            subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any
            other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of
            the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
            Statement of Purpose.
        
        3.  **Public License Fallback.** Should any part of the Waiver for any
            reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable
            law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent
            permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of
            Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer
            hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
            transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
            unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related
            Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
            maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
            future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and
            for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
            including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
            purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
            of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part
            of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
            ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
            ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
            and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
            exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in
            the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
            with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
            express Statement of Purpose.
        
        4.  **Limitations and Disclaimers.**
            
            a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
            abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this
            document.
            
            b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
            warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
            statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
            title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
            infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy,
            or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable,
            all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
            
            c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
            persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
            without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
            Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
            necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use
            of the Work.
            
            d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is
            not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with
            respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

# PyExtend
### *from the PyForge ecosystem*

__THIS PROJECT IS IN ALPHA!__ _YOU HAVE  BE WARNED!_
****

PyThings is an open-source and general purpose development framework design to model, interact with and 
manipulate __any entity__ - abstract or tangible - through a structured model inspired by the _Suggested Upper Merged
Ontology_. It's core focus is on providing a rich, extensible foundation for representing and working with __Things__ in
a flexible and scalable way.

More than a typical object-oriented framework; it's a __generalised, structured way to model reality itself__.
Whether you're building AI-driven applications knowledge graphs, automation systems, or just looking to cut down your workload.
PyThings provides a __standardised yet flexible__ foundation.


## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Python 3.13](https://www.example.com)
- [Example 2](https://www.example.com)

### Installing

PyThings is available as a Python package.

To install:
