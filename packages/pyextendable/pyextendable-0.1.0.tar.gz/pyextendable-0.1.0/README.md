# PyExtend
### *from the PyForge ecosystem*

__THIS PROJECT IS IN ALPHA!__ _YOU HAVE  BE WARNED!_
****

PyThings is an open-source and general purpose development framework design to model, interact with and 
manipulate __any entity__ - abstract or tangible - through a structured model inspired by the _Suggested Upper Merged
Ontology_. It's core focus is on providing a rich, extensible foundation for representing and working with __Things__ in
a flexible and scalable way.

More than a typical object-oriented framework; it's a __generalised, structured way to model reality itself__.
Whether you're building AI-driven applications knowledge graphs, automation systems, or just looking to cut down your workload.
PyThings provides a __standardised yet flexible__ foundation.


## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Python 3.13](https://www.example.com)
- [Example 2](https://www.example.com)

### Installing

PyThings is available as a Python package.

To install:

    pip instal pythings

Additional domains and extensions can be found here, and follow the convention:

    # Domain and definition expansions
    pip install pythings-<domain_name>
    
    # Plugins
    pip install pythings-ext-<name>

Official domains are also downloadable within the codebase but this is generally not recommended.

## Extending & Expanding

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### General Extensions

General extensions are those generally affecting the functionality of the package.

    Give an example

### Domain Specific Extensions

DSFs are those that are specific to a particular domain or use case, and typically expand or form part of the lower ontology.

    Give an example

## Deployment

Add additional notes to deploy this on a live system
