        A product photo of a studio microphone of which the head (grill) is the head of Rick (from Rick and Morty). 
        The microphone is usb connected to a tablet. On the tablet in big letters is written "WHISPER".
        The scene is in a cozy laidback audio studio lit with deep purple and lime colors. The background is blurry. The spotlight is on the microphone.
        The artwork is minimalistic yet striking and cinematic, showcasing a vibrant neon-green lime palette, rendered in an anime-style illustration with 4k detail. 
        Influenced by the artistic styles of Simon Kenny, Giorgetto Giugiaro, Brian Stelfreeze, and Laura Iverson
