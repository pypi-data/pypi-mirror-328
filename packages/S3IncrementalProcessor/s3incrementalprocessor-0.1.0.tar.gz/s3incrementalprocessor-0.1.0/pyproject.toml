description = "Incremental S3 File Processor is a Python package that enables efficient, incremental file processing from an Amazon S3 bucket. It keeps track of processed files using a checkpointing mechanism, ensuring that only new or modified files are processed in subsequent runs. The package supports batch processing, allows resetting checkpoints for reprocessing all data, and correctly handles edge cases like files with identical timestamps. "
