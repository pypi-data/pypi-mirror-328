# OMERO.RuleTagger

## Description
OMERO.RuleTagger Python package for automated tagging of OMERO objects based on customizable rules and regex.

It works by walking the omero model as described by the omero-py wrappers and the underlying ObjectI classes. After the walk it compares a given reference value against the value it walked to, then tags if the condition passes.
