#%% Equations used to evaluate the critical velocity (minimum velocity) required to achieve a uniform dispersion of water in oil

def critical_velocity_for_uniform_wio_dispersion_horizontal(ST_oil_aq, rho_o, rho_aq, Visc_o, D, K1=2.02, G=10):
    '''
    Calculate critical (minimum) velocity for maintaining a dispersion degree G, based on NFOGM HANDBOOK of Water Fraction Metering [1_].
    
    The value G = 10 gives a concentration ratio 0.9, and is recommended by ISO 3171. This corresponds to ±5 % deviation from the mean concentration and it is in
    practise considered as a homogeneous mixture.
    
    The numerical constant K1 depends on the unit system being used, and the default K1 corresponds to SI units, which is being used in this function.
    The function will also work for field SI units (K1 = 0.5), but the units will no longer be valid. 
    
    The method described here should be used with care since it is based on a simplified
    concentration model, as well as other simplified and semi-theoretical models. The
    water concentration model is only valid for small water volume fractions, i.e. less
    than approximately 10–15 % water in oil. 
    
    Equation and info from NFOGM HANDBOOK of Water Fraction Metering (Revision 2, December 2004), chapter 5.1, Equation 2. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    ST_oil_aq : float
        Interfacial (surface) tension between oil and water [N/m].
    rho_o : float
        Oil density [kg/m3].
    rho_aq : float
        Aqueous density [kg/m3].
    Visc_o : float
        Oil viscosity [Pa⋅s].
    D : float
        Inner pipe diameter [m].
    K1 : float
        Constant depending on unit system (SI or field units) The default is 2.02 which corresponds to SI units.
    G : float, optional
        Parameter defining the degree of dispersion (usually G = 10). The default is 10.

    Returns
    -------
    Vc : float
        Critical (minimum) velocity for maintaining a dispersion degree G [m/s].

def critical_velocity_for_uniform_wio_dispersion_vertical(beta, ST_oil_aq, rho_o, rho_aq, Visc_o, D, K2=2910):

    Calculate the critical (minimum) velocity Vc which is required to maintain a homogeneous flow in a vertical, or inclined pipe, based on NFOGM HANDBOOK of Water Fraction Metering [1_].
    The numerical constant K2 depends on the unit system being used and the default K2 corresponds to SI units, which is being used in this function.
    The function will also work for field SI units (K2 = 550), but the units will no longer be valid. 

    This model is valid for vertical and inclined pipe flow (45° - 90° from the horizontal plane).
    Furthermore, the model is valid for low to moderate high water concentrations, i.e.
    20 – 25 %.
