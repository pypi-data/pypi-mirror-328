# Equation Solver Pro


This Python script is designed to solve simple linear equations with one unknown variable (denoted as `x`). The equation can involve addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The script handles equations in various formats, such as `x + a = b`, `a - x = b`, `x * a = b`, and others, and calculates the value of `x` accordingly.



## Features:
- Handles equations where `x` is either on the left or right side of the operator.
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Provides error handling if the input format is incorrect.



## Supported Equation Formats:
- `x+a=b`

- `a+x=b`

- `x-a=b`

- `a-x=b`

- `x*a=b`

- `a*x=b`

- `x/a=b`

- `a/x=b`

- Use only 'x' as a variable. Here 'a' and 'b' are constants(integers).
