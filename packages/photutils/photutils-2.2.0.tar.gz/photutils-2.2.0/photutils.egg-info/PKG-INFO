Photutils is a Python library that provides commonly-used tools
and key functionality for detecting and performing photometry of
astronomical sources. Tools are provided for background estimation,
star finding, source detection and extraction, aperture photometry,
PSF photometry, image segmentation, centroids, radial profiles,
and elliptical isophote fitting. It is an a `coordinated package
<https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html>`_ of `Astropy`_ and
integrates well with other Astropy packages, making it a powerful tool
for astronomical image analysis.

Please see the `online documentation
<https://photutils.readthedocs.io>`_ for `installation instructions
<https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/install.html>`_ and usage
information.
