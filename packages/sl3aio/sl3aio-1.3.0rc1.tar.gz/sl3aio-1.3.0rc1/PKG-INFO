sl3aio is a simple python library that adds asynchronous support and useful tools for the sqlite3.

## Documentation
Check out the [sl3aio documentation](https://sl3aio.readthedocs.io) and get started with it.

## Features
- Safe asynchronous access to any sqlite3 database
- Convinient interface that replaces sqlite3 boiler-plate code
- Wide range of simple built-in tools

## Installation
You can simply install sl3aio from pip:

```shell
pip install sl3aio
```

Other installation methods and usage examples can be found in the documentation.

## Notes
Before working with the library, it is advisable to learn the basics of working with [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html). You can also view the [sqlite3 library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) which is the core of the sl3aio.
