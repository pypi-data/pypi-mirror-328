# PyForge Ecosystem  

**PyForge** is an ecosystem of modular, independent Python packages designed to improve interoperability, efficiency, and rapid prototyping. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools that can be used independently or combined to accelerate development across multiple domains.

## 🚀 Overview  

PyForge is built around the principles of **modularity**, **scalability**, and **extensibility**, ensuring each package serves a well-defined purpose while seamlessly integrating with others. The ecosystem includes utilities for **event-driven architectures, automation, security, data persistence, synchronization, caching, analytics, deployment, and more**.

### 🔹 Why PyForge?  
- **Modular Design** – Use only the packages you need, without unnecessary dependencies.  
- **Interoperability** – Each package is designed to work standalone or as part of a larger system.  
- **Performance-Oriented** – Optimized for concurrency, caching, and efficient execution.  
- **Future-Proof** – Built with extensibility and adaptability in mind.  
- **Enterprise-Ready** – Supports advanced features like security policies, audit logging, and distributed execution.

- Efficient caching mechanisms with **PyCache**.  
- Distributed event & message processing via **PyComms**.  

### 🔐 **Security & Compliance**  
- Access control & authentication through **PyGuard**.  
- Audit logging with **PyAudit** for compliance tracking.  
- Policy-based execution and sandboxing for extensions.  

### 📊 **Observability & Automation**

## ⚡ Installation  

PyForge is designed as a collection of independent packages. You can install them individually as needed:  

```sh
pip install pyutil   # Example: Install PyUtil only
pip install pyextend  # Example: Install PyExtend
```

Or install the full ecosystem:  

```sh
pip install pyforge
```

---

## 🛠 Usage  

### Example 1: Using PyExtend for Event Handling  

```python
from pyextend.events.dispatch import EventDispatcher

dispatcher = EventDispatcher()

def on_custom_event(data):
    print(f"Received event data: {data}")

dispatcher.subscribe("custom_event", on_custom_event)
dispatcher.dispatch("custom_event", {"message": "Hello, PyForge!"})
```

### Example 2: Secure Authentication with PyGuard  

```python
from pyguard.auth import AuthManager

auth = AuthManager()
auth.create_user("admin", "securepassword")

if auth.authenticate("admin", "securepassword"):
    print("Authentication successful!")
```

### Example 3: Caching with PyCache  

```python
from pycache import CacheManager

cache = CacheManager()
cache.set("user_123", {"name": "John Doe", "role": "admin"}, ttl=3600)

user = cache.get("user_123")
print(user)  # Output: {'name': 'John Doe', 'role': 'admin'}
```
