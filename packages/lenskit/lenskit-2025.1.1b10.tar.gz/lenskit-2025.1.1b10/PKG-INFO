# Python recommendation tools

![Test Suite](https://github.com/lenskit/lkpy/workflows/Test%20Suite/badge.svg)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/lenskit/lkpy/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/lenskit/lkpy)

LensKit is a set of Python tools for experimenting with and studying recommender
systems.  It provides support for training, running, and evaluating recommender
algorithms in a flexible fashion suitable for research and education.

LensKit for Python (LKPY) is the successor to the Java-based LensKit project.
