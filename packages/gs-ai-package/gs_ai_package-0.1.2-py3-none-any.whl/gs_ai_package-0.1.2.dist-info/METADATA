# GS AI Package

The **GS AI Package** is a library developed for standardizing and streamlining internal projects for the GreenShare Experiments team. This package provides a suite of tools to associate directional information with public transport data, specifically for occupancy (crowding) and evasion data provided by public transport companies.

## Features

- **DirectionProcessor Class**: A new class introduced in version **0.1.1**.
  - Associates the direction with public transport data.
  - Provides methods to process, normalize, and fill missing values in the data.
  - Uniformizes directional information across various projects.
  
- **Data Processing Functions**: Includes functions to:
  - Check if column names are in snake_case.
  - Calculate direction distribution based on the most common values.
  - Fill missing directions using trip-based modes.
  - Uniformize direction values within groups.

## Installation

You can install the package from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
pip install gs_ai_package
```

For testing and development, you can also install it from TestPyPI:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ gs_ai_package
```
## Running Tests

The package includes tests to verify functionality and ensure code quality. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. **Install Testing Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have `pytest` and `pytest-cov` installed:
   
   ```bash
   pip install pytest pytest-cov
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**

   From the root directory of the project, run:
   
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=gs_ai_package --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

   This command runs all tests and shows a coverage report in the terminal.
