    Test the PMXCrossover class for generating offspring from two permutation parents.

    This test verifies that the PMXCrossover class correctly performs partially matched crossover
    (PMX) between two parent individuals. It ensures that:
    1. The offspring generated have the same chromosome size as the parents.

    The test performs the following checks:
    - Both offspring have the same chromosome size as the parents.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If any of the conditions for the crossover operation are not met.
