    Apply requested modifications to a code file.

    This function retrieves a prompt template for single file code modifications,
    inserts the provided code content and requested changes, and (if enabled)
    allows for interactive editing of the prompt before sending it to OpenAI.

    Args:
        code (str): The current content of the code.
        changes (str): The changes to be applied to the code.
        reasoning_effort (str): The reasoning effort level used for requesting changes.
        interactive (bool): Whether to allow interactive editing of the prompt.

    Returns:
        str: The updated code with the applied modifications.

    Improvements made:
      - Provided a clear docstring and type annotations.
      - Renamed intermediate variables for enhanced readability.
      - Consolidated prompt modifications to enhance maintainability.
