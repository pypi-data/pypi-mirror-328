===========================
Catchment Grassland Module
===========================
This module provides functionality for managing and analyzing grassland data within specified catchment areas. 
It is designed to support environmental and agricultural studies, focusing on grassland distribution, usage, and management strategies under 
various scenarios.

The module primarily includes the CatchmentGrass class, which interfaces with different data sources to aggregate, process, 
and calculate grassland areas. It utilizes a combination of catchment-specific grassland data, proportion data for grassland areas, 
and scenario-based analysis to derive insights about grassland utilization and distribution.

Key Features:
- Aggregation of grassland area data by cover type for specific catchment areas.
- Calculation of grassland area proportions based on different environmental and agricultural scenarios.
- Utilization of external data sources and APIs for up-to-date and accurate grassland data retrieval.
- Support for scenario-based analysis to aid in environmental impact studies and agricultural planning.

Classes:
- CatchmentGrass: Manages and processes grassland data for a given catchment area.

Dependencies:
- catchment_data_api.CatchmentDataAPI: For fetching catchment-specific grassland data.
- resource_manager.data_loader.Loader: For loading necessary proportion data.
- resource_manager.grassland_data_manager.DataManager: For additional data management and calculation needs.
- grassland_production.grassland_data_manager.DataManager: For additional data management and calculation needs.
- pandas: For data handling and processing.

Note:
This module is part of a larger suite of environmental analysis tools and should be used in conjunction with other related 
modules and datasets for comprehensive analysis.

    A class to manage and process grassland data for a specified catchment.

    This class interfaces with various data sources to aggregate and calculate
    grassland area data relevant to a given catchment area. It leverages data
    from CatchmentDataAPI for catchment-specific grassland data, uses Loader 
    to retrieve grassland area proportions, and utilizes DataManager for 
    additional data management and calculations.

    Attributes:
        api (CatchmentDataAPI): An instance of CatchmentDataAPI to fetch catchment-specific grassland data.
        loader_class (Loader): An instance of Loader to load necessary proportion data.
        data_manager_class (DataManager): An instance of DataManager for data management and calculation.
        catchment (str): The name of the catchment area.
        calibration_year (int): The year for which calibration is done.
        default_grassland_year (int): Default year for grassland data, set from the DataManager instance.

    Args:
        catchment (str): The name of the catchment area.
        calibration_year (int): The year for which calibration is done.
        target_year (int): The target year for the analysis.
        scenario_data (pandas.DataFrame): DataFrame containing scenario data.
        scenario_animals_df (pandas.DataFrame): DataFrame containing animal data for the scenario.
        baseline_animals_df (pandas.DataFrame): DataFrame containing baseline animal data.

    Methods:
        get_catchment_grassland_areas(self):
            Retrieves and sums grassland areas by cover type for the catchment.
            Returns a DataFrame with area in hectares.

        get_catchment_grassland_area_calculated(self):
            Calculates grassland area based on catchment data and proportion data.
            Returns a DataFrame with calculated grassland areas.
