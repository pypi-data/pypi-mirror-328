    The error handling of the multipathd service startup/discovery process.
    IPA handles both scenario when the multipathd service is already started
    and the scenario when the service has not been started and in the second
    scenario IPA will try to start the service. IPA is not pre checking whether
    multipathd is running already or not, it will start the multipathd service
    even if it is already running and expects 0 error code . It has been
    noticed that with certain combinations of Linux distros and multipathd
    versions the error code is not 0 when IPA tries to start multipathd in
    case an instance of multipathd is already running.
    When the expected return code is not 0 an exception will be thrown and that
    will cause the multipath device discovery to terminate prematurely and
    if the selected root device is a multipath device then IPA won't be
    able to provision.
    This fix discards the exception that is caused by the non 0 error code
    returned by the multipathd startup process. In case there is a genuine
    issue with the multipath service, that would be caught when the actual
    multipath device listing command is executed (multipath -ll).
