"""
In order to work, this extension adds a number of new classes and functions:

* 1 domain - `InlineReferenceDomain` - through which all user-level interactions are exposed and
  which manages persistent data.

* 4 roles within the domain, which allow users to create hyperlinks

  * ``:iref:ref:`` which is handled by `RegisteredXRefRole`
  * ``:iref:target:`` which is handled by `ReferenceTargetRole`
  * ``:iref:backlink:`` which is handled by `BackLinkRole`
  * ``:iref:mref:`` which is handled by `MutualReferenceRole`

* 5 nodes created by the roles and which handle the creation of the links

  * `inline_reference` which identical to the `docutils.nodes.reference` class except for the LaTeX
    build system, and which handles the normal references, from ``:iref:ref:`` to ``:iref:target:``

  * `id_reference` which is similar to `docutils.nodes.reference`, but which holds its own ID to be
    able to be hyperlinked to, and which is used in the references from ``:iref:ref:`` to
    ``:iref:backlink:``

  * `reference_target` which is the simple target for hyperlinks and which is used to represent
    ``:iref:target:``

  * `backlink` which is a new class for representing ``:iref:backlink:``

  * `mutual_ref` which is a new class for working with ``:iref:mref:``

* 2 event hooks for the ``doctree-resolved`` event

  * `process_mutual_reference_nodes` for connecting the pairs of `mutual_ref` nodes, once all the
    nodes have been created.

  * `process_backlink_nodes` for connecting each `backlink` node to each `id_reference` node that
    links to it.

* various ``visit_`` and ``depart_`` functions that implement the writing of each supported output
  format in the cases where the default implementations are not sufficient or similar enough
  functionality does not exist.


How This Works
--------------

Referencing a Normal Target
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By creating a link from ``:iref:ref:name<id>`` to ``:iref:target:name<id>``, two nodes are created
in the middle of the paragraph: a `sphinx.addnodes.pending_xref` node for the reference, and a
`reference_target` node for the target. On creation of the target, it is registered with the domain.
Then, once the entire .rst document is read and all nodes are finished loading, sphinx starts
resolving pending references, which calls the `ReferenceDomain.resolve_xref` method for each
``pending_xref`` node. The domain matches the ``id`` from the ``pending_xref`` to the appropriate
``target``, using the saved information. An `inline_reference` node is created, which will replace
the ``pending_xref`` node. This new node has the ``refid`` and ``refuri`` parameters set and
pointing to the ``ids`` parameter of the `reference_target` node. All that happens after is that
the writer for the selected format will appropriately use this information so that a hyperlink is
created in the output.


Referencing a Backlink
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By creating a link from ``:iref:ref:name<id>`` to ``:iref:backlink:name<id>``, two nodes are created
in the middle of the paragraph: a `sphinx.addnodes.pending_xref` node for the reference, and a
`reference_target` node for the target. On creation of each, they are registered with the domain,
the reference in the ``loose_refs`` dict and the target in the ``targets`` list. However, since
the reference will need an ID to be able to be linked to, but the only information we have is the ID
of the backlink, the domain creates a unique ID for the reference when registering it.

Then, once the entire .rst document is read and all nodes are finished loading, sphinx starts
resolving pending references, which calls the `ReferenceDomain.resolve_xref` method for each
``pending_xref`` node. Similar to the target case above, the domain matches the ``id`` from the
``pending_xref`` to the appropriate `backlink`. An `id_reference` node is created with the
``refid`` and ``refuri`` parameters set and pointing to the ``ids`` parameter of the `backlink`,
which will allow for the creation of a hyperlink from the reference to the backlink. To enable the
converse, the `id_reference` node's ``ids`` parameter is set to the first stored unique ID that has
not been used yet.

Furthermore, once the tree for the document has been fully resolved, sphinx emits the
``doctree-resolved`` event and calls the `process_backlink_nodes`` function, which finishes the job.
It populates the ``backrefs`` parameter of each `backlink` node with the unique IDs of each
`id_reference` node, using the data from the domain. All that happens after is that
the writer for the selected format will appropriately use this information so that a hyperlink is
created in the output.

Mutual References
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By using ``:iref:mref:name<id>`` twice, with the same ID, two `mutual_ref` nodes are created in the
middle of the paragraph. On creation of each, they are registered with the domain, in the
``mutual_refs`` dict. However, since the user provides only one ID, and two will be required under
the hood (one for each node), the domain also creates a unique ID for each, which is immediately
set to the ``ids`` parameter of the created nodes.

Then, once the tree for the document has been fully resolved, sphinx emits the ``doctree-resolved``
event and calls the `process_mutual_reference_nodes` function. This goes over each `mutual_ref` in
the document and edits its ``refid`` and ``refuri`` parameters to point to the ID of the other
corresponding `mutual_ref` node. All that happens after is that
the writer for the selected format will appropriately use this information so that a hyperlink is
created in the output.

        """
        Adds a mutual reference (`MutualReference`) to the domain and generates a unique ID for the
        node.

        Saves the original signature of the node, the name of the document in which the node was
        found, and the new unique ID, to the domain data for mutual references.

        The unique ID can be used do distinguish between the two `mutual_ref` nodes, since they are
        created using the same `signature`. This is an internal implementation detail required to
        make the hyperlinks work without placing undue effort on the users.

        Parameters
        ----------
        signature
            The signature of the node - the code/label used to identify the target for the reference
