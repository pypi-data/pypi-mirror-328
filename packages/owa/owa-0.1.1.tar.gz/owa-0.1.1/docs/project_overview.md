# Open World Agents - Detailed Overview

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the core functionalities and underlying logic of the Open World Agents codebase. Open World Agents is a modular agent system, where a variety of modules are dynamically registered and utilized at runtime. Below, you will find an in-depth description of the core logic, sample code, and a range of additional example projects.

## 1. Introduction

Open World Agents leverages a registration pattern that allows multiple modules to be dynamically activated during runtime. Each module's functionalities are registered in a global registry using dedicated dictionaries: CALLABLES for synchronous functions and LISTENERS for asynchronous/event-driven listeners.

## 2. Core Architecture and Registry Pattern

- **Registry (CALLABLES & LISTENERS):**
  - **CALLABLES:** Stores module-provided functionalities as key-value pairs (e.g., registered as `clock.time_ns`). What developer must implement is just `__call__` function.
  - **LISTENERS:** Manages classes responsible for event handling by storing them under designated keys (e.g., registered as `clock/tick`). This class takes `callback` as argument in `__init__` and otherwise it's same as `Runnables`.
  - **RUNNABLES:** This is parent class of `Listeners` and it supports `start/stop/join` operations in user side and developer must implement `loop/cleanup` methods.

Modules are activated via the `activate_module` function, during which their functions and listeners are systematically added to the global registry.

## 3. Detailed Explanation of Core Logic

### 3.1. Standard Environment (owa.env.std)

The `projects/core/main.py` file initiates the standard environment. In the following example:

```python
import time
from owa.registry import CALLABLES, LISTENERS, activate_module

# Initial registry state (empty)
print(CALLABLES, LISTENERS)  # {}, {}

# Activate the standard module to register clock functionalities
activate_module("owa.env.std")
print(CALLABLES, LISTENERS)
# Example: 'clock.time_ns' is registered in CALLABLES and 'clock/tick' in LISTENERS

# Testing the clock/tick listener
tick = LISTENERS["clock/tick"]()
tick.configure(callback=lambda: print(CALLABLES["clock.time_ns"]()), interval=1)
tick.activate()

time.sleep(1)  # The listener prints the current time in nanoseconds a few times

tick.deactivate()
tick.shutdown()
```

This code demonstrates how activating the standard module registers clock-related functions and listeners, enabling real-time time display.

### 3.2. Desktop Environment (owa.env.desktop)

After the standard module, the desktop module is activated. This module provides user interface and input-related features. For example:

```python
# Activate the desktop module to enable UI and input capabilities
activate_module("owa.env.desktop")

# Using screen capture and window management features
print(CALLABLES["screen.capture"]().shape)  # Example output: (1080, 1920, 3)
print(CALLABLES["window.get_active_window"])()
print(CALLABLES["window.get_window_by_title"]("open-world-agents"))

# Simulating a mouse click (left button, double click)
mouse_click = CALLABLES["mouse.click"]
mouse_click("left", 2)

# Configuring a keyboard listener

def on_keyboard_event(event_type, key):
    print(f"Keyboard event: {event_type}, {key}")

keyboard_listener = LISTENERS["keyboard"]()
keyboard_listener.configure(on_keyboard_event)
keyboard_listener.activate()

time.sleep(5)
```

This snippet illustrates functionalities such as capturing the screen, managing windows, handling mouse clicks, and responding to keyboard events.

### 3.3. Custom Extensions

The framework also supports custom modules. For instance, a module that integrates with Minecraft can be activated and used as shown below:

```python
# Example of a custom module integration with Minecraft
activate_module("owa_minecraft")
inventory = CALLABLES["minecraft.get_inventory"](player="Steve")
```

This flexibility allows developers to extend system capabilities without altering the core codebase.

## 4. Advanced Features and Extension Points

- **Modularity:** New modules can be seamlessly added, registered, and activated without modifying existing code.
- **Dynamic Activation:** The `activate_module` function allows modules to be enabled at runtime, enhancing system extensibility and flexibility.
- **Event-Driven Design:** Listeners handle asynchronous events, enabling real-time responses to external inputs.

## 6. Overview of Additional Example Projects

Within the `/projects` directory, besides the core module, several example projects are available:

- **data_collection:** Example projects focusing on data collection and processing agents.
- **minecraft_env:** A project that integrates with Minecraft to manipulate and process in-game data.
- **core:** Contains the main logic and core modules, including the functionalities discussed above.

These projects showcase the system's extensibility, modularity, and diverse application scenarios.

## 9. In-Depth Core Logic Analysis

The example in `projects/core/main.py` demonstrates the following flow:

- **Initial State:** At startup, the CALLABLES and LISTENERS registries are empty.
- **Standard Module Activation:** Upon calling `activate_module("owa.env.std")`, clock-related functionalities such as `clock.time_ns` and the `clock/tick` listener are registered.
- **Listener Utilization:** The `clock/tick` listener invokes a callback to print the current time in nanoseconds, illustrating its activation, deactivation, and shutdown processes.
- **Desktop Features:** Subsequent activation of `owa.env.desktop` registers functionalities for screen capture, window management, and input handling.
- **Extensibility:** Custom modules (e.g., `owa_minecraft`) can be integrated effortlessly to extend the system's capabilities.

## 10. Dependencies and Environment

- **Python Version:** The project requires Python 3.11 or higher.
- **Platform-Specific Dependencies:**
  - Windows: `pygetwindow`
  - macOS: `pyobjc-framework-Quartz`, `pyobjc-framework-ApplicationServices`
- **Common Dependencies:**
  - `pynput` for keyboard and mouse events
  - `opencv-python` and `bettercam` for screen capture and image processing
  - `loguru` for logging
  - `pydantic` for data validation and management

The project configuration is defined in the `pyproject.toml` file, and a suitable virtual environment (e.g., specifying the UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT variable) is required.

## 11. Testing and Quality Assurance

A comprehensive suite of tests ensures the stability and reliability of the core functionalities and modules, located in the `projects/core/tests` directory. These tests validate:

- The correct registration and deregistration of module functionalities.
- Proper initialization of modules via `activate_module`.
- Accurate event handling and callback execution for various listeners (e.g., `clock/tick`, `keyboard`).
- Platform-specific behavior for functionalities like screen capture and window management.

Maintaining robust testing practices ensures the system's stability and extensibility. Contributors are encouraged to update tests alongside their changes.
