# Event System

The event system in Open World Agents provides efficient asynchronous event handling through dedicated listener objects. Each listener is designed to monitor and respond to specific events (such as clock ticks or keyboard inputs) by executing pre-configured callbacks.

## How It Works

- **Listener Activation:** Listeners are dynamically activated using configuration methods that set up relevant callbacks and intervals.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Once activated, listeners operate asynchronously, allowing the system to handle events in real time without blocking overall execution.
- **Dynamic Management:** Listeners can be deactivated or shut down when they are no longer needed, ensuring flexible event management.

This event-driven architecture is fundamental to achieving responsive and scalable behavior in Open World Agents.
