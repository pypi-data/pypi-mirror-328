    Utilizing this function is not preferred, as this function must be called in main thread, which is not guaranteed in common.

    Otherwise, you may pass CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP to the subprocess.Popen() function. After that, you must pass CTRL_BREAK_EVENT instead of CTRL_C_EVENT(it does NOT work).
