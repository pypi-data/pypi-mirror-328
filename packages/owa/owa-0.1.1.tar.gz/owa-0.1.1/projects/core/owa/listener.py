# ================ Definition of the Callable and Listener classes ================
# To deal with the state and action with regard to environment, we need to define the Callable and Listener classes.
# The Callable class is used to:
#     - define the callable that acquires the state
#     - define the callable that performs the action
# The Listener class is used to:
#     - define the listener that listens to the state
#
# Main differences between the Callable and Listener classes is where/whom the function is called.
#     - the Callable class is called by the user
#     - while the Listener class provides the interface for the environment to call the user-defined function.
