## Overview

**puregen** is a lightweight wrapper built on top of [datamodel-code-generator](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator) that resolves the issue of having all generated code dumped into a single file. Instead, puregen automatically organizes your code into well-structured folders and files, making your project much easier to maintain.

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Structuring:** Divides generated code into logical modules and directories.
- **Seamless Imports:** Automatically generates the necessary import statements between files.
- **Efficient for Large Projects:** Ideal for projects with a vast number of models where managing a single file becomes cumbersome.

> **Note:** This is the first version of puregen and is still under active development. We welcome your feedback and suggestions!
