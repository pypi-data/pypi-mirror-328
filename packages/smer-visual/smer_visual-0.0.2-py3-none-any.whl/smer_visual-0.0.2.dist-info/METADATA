# **SMERVisual**

SMERVisual is a Python package designed for explainable machine learning using the **SMER method**. It provides an intuitive interface for analyzing image classification models by highlighting key features and generating bounding boxes around important words in source images.

The package supports both **OpenAI API** models and **local language models**, offering flexibility in model selection.

---

## **Installation**
Install SMERVisual using pip:
```sh
pip install smer-visual
```

---

## **Features**

### **ImageClassifier**
The `ImageClassifier` class performs **logistic regression-based classification** on image datasets while computing **LIME** and **SMER** values for explainability. Key features include:

- Classification of image datasets using pre-trained language models
- Computation of **LIME and SMER scores** for each word in the dataset
- Visualization of **most important words** for explainability

### **BoundingBoxGenerator**
The `BoundingBoxGenerator` class enhances model interpretability by overlaying bounding boxes on images, highlighting **critical words** identified in classification. It:

- Uses **ImageClassifier output** to detect significant words
- Supports **vision models from OpenAI** and **open-source alternatives**
- Enables **zero-shot object detection** for explainable AI

---

## **Usage Example**
Here's a simple way to use **SMERVisual** for explainable image classification:

```python
from smer_visual import ImageClassifier, BoundingBoxGenerator

# Initialize and train the classifier
classifier = ImageClassifier(model="openai", dataset="path/to/dataset")
classifier()
influential_words = classifier.get_top_words()

# Generate bounding boxes for top words
bbox_generator = BoundingBoxGenerator(data='path/to/dataset', top_words = influential_words, 
                                      local_model_path='path/to/local/model')
bbox_generator("path/to/image.jpg")
```
