This package provides strongly-typed configuration bindings for Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ version 5.17.6. It enables you to define your ActiveMQ broker configurations in code instead of raw XML.

The types in this library are intended to be used with the [@cdklabs/cdk-amazonmq](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-amazonmq) library and allow for providing strongly-typed configuration of ActiveMQ brokers that is generated from [the XML schema definition tailored for the Amazon MQ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/amazon-mq-broker-configuration-parameters.html#working-with-spring-xml-configuration-files).

An example of using this library can be found below:

```python
// Basic broker configuration
const broker = new Broker({
  schedulePeriodForDestinationPurge: 10000,
  start: false
}, {
  // Destination interceptors configuration
  destinationInterceptors: [
    // ... interceptor configuration
  ],

  // Persistence configuration
  persistenceAdapter: new KahaDB({
    // ... persistence configuration
  }),

  // Policy configuration
  destinationPolicy: new PolicyMap({
    // ... policy configuration
  }),

  // ... other sections
});
```

> **LDAP Integration Note:**
> Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ [enables LDAP integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/security-authentication-authorization.html) which requires using `cachedLDAPAuthorizationMap`. See [ActiveMQ documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/components/classic/documentation/cached-ldap-authorization-module) for more details. The types in this package include the `CachedLDAPAuthorizationMap` type with attributes specifically enabled by Amazon MQ for ActiveMQ.
