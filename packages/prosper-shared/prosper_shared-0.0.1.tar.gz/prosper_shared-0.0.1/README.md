## prosper_shared.autohooks

Pre-commit hooks for use with `autohooks`.

## prosper_shared.omni_config

Util for defining, parsing, merging, validating, and using configs from various sources, including file-based configs,
environment variables, and command-line arguments. This will probably be factored out into an independent library.
