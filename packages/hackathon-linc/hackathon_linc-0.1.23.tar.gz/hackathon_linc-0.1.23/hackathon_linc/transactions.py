    This is a private function for placing buy, sell, and stoploss orders for securities.

    Args:
        order_type (str): The type of order (buy, sell, or stoploss)
        ticker (str): A security ticker (ex: STOCK1, STOCK2, etc.)
        amount (int): Number of shares
        price (int, optional): The price for which you want the security to be under in order to buy. If not specified, the order will be placed at the current price. Defaults to None.
        days_to_cancel (int, optional): How many days you want this trade to stay active: e.g entering 30 means that trade will be held for 30 days and then cancelled if security price never reaches given price to buy. Defaults to None.
