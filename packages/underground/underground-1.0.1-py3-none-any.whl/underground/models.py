    A VehiclePosition entity is provided for every trip when it starts moving. Note that
    a train can be assigned (see TripUpdate) but has not started to move (e.g. a train
    waiting to leave the origin station), therefore, no VehiclePosition is provided.

    The motivation to include VehiclePosition is to provide the timestamp field. This
    is the time of the last detected movement of the train. This allows feed consumers
    to detect the situation when a train stops moving (aka stalled). The platform
    countdown clocks only count down when trains are moving otherwise they persist the
    last published arrival time for that train. If one wants to mimic this behavior you
    must first determine the absence of movement (stalled train condition) ), then the
    countdown must be stopped.

    As an example, a countdown could be stopped for a trip when the difference between
    the timestamp in the VehiclePosition and the timestamp in the field header is
    greater than, 90 seconds.

    Note: since VehiclePosition information is not provided until the train starts
    moving, it is recommended that feed consumers use the origin terminal departure to
    determine a train stalled condition.
