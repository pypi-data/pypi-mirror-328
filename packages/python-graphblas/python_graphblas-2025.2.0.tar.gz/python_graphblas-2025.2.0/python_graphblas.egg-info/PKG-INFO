              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Install

Install the latest version of Python-graphblas via conda:

```
$ conda install -c conda-forge python-graphblas
```

or pip:

```
$ pip install 'python-graphblas[default]'
```

This will also install the [SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/GraphBLAS) compiled C library.
We currently support the [GraphBLAS C API 2.0 specification](https://graphblas.org/docs/GraphBLAS_API_C_v2.0.0.pdf).

### Optional Dependencies

The following are not required by python-graphblas, but may be needed for certain functionality to work.

- `pandas` – required for nicer `__repr__`;
- `matplotlib` – required for basic plotting of graphs;
- `scipy` – used in `io` module to read/write `scipy.sparse` format;
- `networkx` – used in `io` module to interface with `networkx` graphs;
- `fast-matrix-market` - for faster read/write of Matrix Market files with `gb.io.mmread` and `gb.io.mmwrite`.

## Description

Currently works with [SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/GraphBLAS), but the goal is to make it work with all implementations of the GraphBLAS spec.

The approach taken with this library is to follow the C-API 2.0 specification as closely as possible while making improvements
allowed with the Python syntax. Because the spec always passes in the output object to be written to, we follow the same,
which is very different from the way Python normally operates. In fact, many who are familiar with other Python data
libraries (numpy, pandas, etc) will find it strange to not create new objects for every call.

At the highest level, the goal is to separate output, mask, and accumulator on the left side of the assignment
operator `=` and put the computation on the right side. Unfortunately, that approach doesn't always work very well
with how Python handles assignment, so instead we (ab)use the left-shift `<<` notation to give the same flavor of
assignment. This opens up all kinds of nice possibilities.

This is an example of how the mapping works:

```C
// C call
GrB_Matrix_mxm(M, mask, GrB_PLUS_INT64, GrB_MIN_PLUS_INT64, A, B, NULL)
```

```python
# Python call
M(mask.V, accum=binary.plus) << A.mxm(B, semiring.min_plus)
```

The expression on the right `A.mxm(B)` creates a delayed object which does no computation. Once it is used in the
`<<` expression with `M`, the whole thing is translated into the equivalent GraphBLAS call.

Delayed objects also have a `.new()` method which can be used to force computation and return a new
object. This is convenient and often appropriate, but will create many unnecessary objects if used in a loop. It
also loses the ability to perform accumulation with existing results. For best performance, following the standard
GraphBLAS approach of (1) creating the object outside the loop and (2) using the object repeatedly within each loop
is a much better approach, even if it doesn't feel very Pythonic.

Descriptor flags are set on the appropriate elements to keep logic close to what it affects. Here is the same call
with descriptor bits set. `ttcsr` indicates transpose the first and second matrices, complement the structure of the mask,
and do a replacement on the output.

```C
// C call
GrB_Matrix_mxm(M, mask, GrB_PLUS_INT64, GrB_MIN_PLUS_INT64, A, B, desc.ttcsr)
```

```python
# Python call
M(~mask.S, accum=binary.plus, replace=True) << A.T.mxm(B.T, semiring.min_plus)
```

The objects receiving the flag operations (A.T, ~mask, etc) are also delayed objects. They hold on to the state but
do no computation, allowing the correct descriptor bits to be set in a single GraphBLAS call.

**If no mask or accumulator is used, the call looks like this**:

```python
M << A.mxm(B, semiring.min_plus)
```

The use of `<<` to indicate updating is actually just syntactic sugar for a real `.update()` method. The above
expression could be written as:

```python
M.update(A.mxm(B, semiring.min_plus))
```

## Operations

```python
M(mask, accum) << A.mxm(B, semiring)        # mxm
w(mask, accum) << A.mxv(v, semiring)        # mxv
w(mask, accum) << v.vxm(B, semiring)        # vxm
M(mask, accum) << A.ewise_add(B, binaryop)  # eWiseAdd
M(mask, accum) << A.ewise_mult(B, binaryop) # eWiseMult
M(mask, accum) << A.kronecker(B, binaryop)  # kronecker
M(mask, accum) << A.T                       # transpose
```

## Extract

```python
M(mask, accum) << A[rows, cols]             # rows and cols are a list or a slice
w(mask, accum) << A[rows, col_index]        # extract column
w(mask, accum) << A[row_index, cols]        # extract row
s = A[row_index, col_index].value           # extract single element
```

## Assign

```python
M(mask, accum)[rows, cols] << A             # rows and cols are a list or a slice
M(mask, accum)[rows, col_index] << v        # assign column
M(mask, accum)[row_index, cols] << v        # assign row
M(mask, accum)[rows, cols] << s             # assign scalar to many elements
M[row_index, col_index] << s                # assign scalar to single element
                                            # (mask and accum not allowed)
del M[row_index, col_index]                 # remove single element
```

## Apply

```python
M(mask, accum) << A.apply(unaryop)
M(mask, accum) << A.apply(binaryop, left=s)   # bind-first
M(mask, accum) << A.apply(binaryop, right=s)  # bind-second
```

## Reduce

```python
v(mask, accum) << A.reduce_rowwise(op)      # reduce row-wise
v(mask, accum) << A.reduce_columnwise(op)   # reduce column-wise
s(accum) << A.reduce_scalar(op)
s(accum) << v.reduce(op)
```

## Creating new Vectors / Matrices

```python
A = Matrix.new(dtype, num_rows, num_cols)   # new_type
B = A.dup()                                 # dup
A = Matrix.from_coo([row_indices], [col_indices], [values])  # build
```

## New from delayed

Delayed objects can be used to create a new object using `.new()` method

```python
C = A.mxm(B, semiring).new()
```

## Properties

```python
size = v.size                               # size
nrows = M.nrows                             # nrows
ncols = M.ncols                             # ncols
nvals = M.nvals                             # nvals
rindices, cindices, vals = M.to_coo()       # extractTuples
```

## Initialization

There is a mechanism to initialize `graphblas` with a context prior to use. This allows for setting the backend to
use as well as the blocking/non-blocking mode. If the context is not initialized, a default initialization will
be performed automatically.

```python
import graphblas as gb

# Context initialization must happen before any other imports
gb.init("suitesparse", blocking=True)

# Now we can import other items from graphblas
from graphblas import binary, semiring
from graphblas import Matrix, Vector, Scalar
```

## Performant User Defined Functions

Python-graphblas requires `numba` which enables compiling user-defined Python functions to native C for use in GraphBLAS.

Example customized UnaryOp:

```python
from graphblas import unary

def force_odd_func(x):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return x + 1
    return x

unary.register_new("force_odd", force_odd_func)

v = Vector.from_coo([0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 3])
w = v.apply(unary.force_odd).new()
w  # indexes=[0, 1, 3], values=[1, 3, 3]
```

Similar methods exist for BinaryOp, Monoid, and Semiring.

## Relation to other network analysis libraries

Python-graphblas aims to provide an efficient and consistent expression
of graph operations using linear algebra. This allows the development of
high-performance implementations of existing and new graph algorithms
(also see [`graphblas-algorithms`](https://github.com/python-graphblas/graphblas-algorithms)).

While end-to-end analysis can be done using `python-graphblas`, users
might find that other libraries in the Python ecosystem provide a more
convenient high-level interface for data pre-processing and transformation
(e.g. `pandas`, `scipy.sparse`), visualization (e.g. `networkx`, `igraph`),
interactive exploration and analysis (e.g. `networkx`, `igraph`) or for
algorithms that are not (yet) implemented in `graphblas-algorithms` (e.g.
`networkx`, `igraph`, `scipy.sparse.csgraph`). To facilitate communication with
other libraries, `graphblas.io` contains multiple connectors, see the
following section.

## Import/Export connectors to the Python ecosystem

`graphblas.io` contains functions for converting to and from:

```python
import graphblas as gb

# scipy.sparse matrices
A = gb.io.from_scipy_sparse(m)
m = gb.io.to_scipy_sparse(m, format="csr")

# networkx graphs
A = gb.io.from_networkx(g)
g = gb.io.to_networkx(A)

# numpy arrays can use `from_dense` and `to_dense` on Vector and Matrix
v = gb.Vector.from_dense(m)
m = v.to_dense()

A = gb.Matrix.from_dense(m, missing_value=0)
m = A.to_dense(fill_value=0)
```
