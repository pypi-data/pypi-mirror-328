Introduction
============

variPEPS is a Python tensor network library developed for variational ground
state simulations in two spatial dimensions applying gradient optimization using
automatic differentation.

For a detailed report on the method, please see `our open-access publication on
SciPost (doi:10.21468/SciPostPhysLectNotes.86)
<https://doi.org/10.21468/SciPostPhysLectNotes.86>`_.
