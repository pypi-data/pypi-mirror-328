This repository contains the implementation of the IngesTables paper (TBD).

It contains library code that defines the data preprocessing, training, and
evaluation. It also contains scripts for running it locally or on Google Cloud
Platform (GCP). Do note that using the GCP scripts may incur costs and would
transmit data to GCP and be accessible to those who can access your GCP project.
