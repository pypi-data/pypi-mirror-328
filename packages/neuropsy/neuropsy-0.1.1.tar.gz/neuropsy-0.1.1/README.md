### Launching the Application

## If the Command Doesn‚Äôt Work

If the run-neuropsy command is not found, it means the package‚Äôs executable is not in your system‚Äôs PATH. Follow these steps to fix it:

### On macOS/Linux

1. Open a terminal 
Find the path to the run-neuropsy executable:

```bash
which run-neuropsy
```
This will output something like /Users/yourusername/py3/bin/run-neuropsy.

Open your shell configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc):

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc # or nano ~/.zshrc
```

Add the following line to the file:

```bash
export PATH="/Users/yourusername/py3/bin:$PATH"
```
Save and exit (Ctrl + O, then Ctrl + X).

Reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.zshrc
```

Verify the command works:

```bash
run-neuropsy
```

### On Windows

1. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell.

Find the path to the run-neuropsy executable:

```bash
where run-neuropsy
```     

Add the path to your Python environment to your PATH environment variable:

```bash
set PATH="C:\path\to\your\python\environment\Scripts;%PATH%"
``` 

Verify the command works:

```bash
run-neuropsy
```
