{system_prompt}

Below is a question and a list of topics extracted from answers to that question. Each topic has a topic_label and a topic_description.

Your task is to analyze these topics and produce a refined list that:
1. Identifies and preserves core themes that appear frequently
2. Combines redundant topics while maintaining nuanced differences
3. Ensures the final list represents the full spectrum of viewpoints present in the original data

Guidelines for Topic Analysis:
- Begin by identifying distinct concept clusters in the topics
- Consider the context of the question when determining topic relevance
- Look for complementary perspectives that could enrich understanding of the same core concept
- Consider the key ideas behind themes when merging, don't simply focus on the words used in the label and description

For each topic in your output:
1. Choose a clear, representative label that captures the essence of the combined or preserved topic
2. Write a concise description that incorporates key insights from all constituent topics, this should only be a single sentence

Return at most 30 topics

The final output should be in the following JSON format:

{{"responses": [
    {{"topic_label": "{{label for condensed topic 1}}", "topic_description": "{{description for condensed topic 1}}"}},
    {{"topic_label": "{{label for condensed topic 2}}", "topic_description": "{{description for condensed topic 2}}"}},
    {{"topic_label": "{{label for condensed topic 3}}", "topic_description": "{{description for condensed topic 3}}"}},
    // Additional topics as necessary
]}}
