# python-hilo

`python-hilo` (aka `pyhilo`) is a Python 3.11, `asyncio`-driven interface to the unofficial
Hilo API from Hydro Quebec. This is meant to be integrated into Home Assistant but can also
be used as a standalone library.

Home assistant integration is available [here](https://github.com/dvd-dev/hilo)

## TODO
- Type everything: almost done, got a few "type: ignore" to fix

## Later?
- Full docstrings and doc generation
- Unit testing
- Functional testing
