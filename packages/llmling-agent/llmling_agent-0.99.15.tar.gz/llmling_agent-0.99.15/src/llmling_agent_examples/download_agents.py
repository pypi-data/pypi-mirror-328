"""Example comparing sequential and parallel downloads with agents.

This example explains:
- Continouos repetitive tasks
- Async parallel execution of LLM calls
- YAML config definitions
- Capability use: list other agents and delegate tasks
- Simple stateful callback mechanism using a class
- Storage providers: SQLite and pretty-printed text files
