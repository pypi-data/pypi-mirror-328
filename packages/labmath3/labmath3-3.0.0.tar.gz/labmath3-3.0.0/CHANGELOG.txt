Version 3.0.0:

Minor alterations to behavior:
    divcountsieve is now a generator.
    ecadd is now _ecadd.
    ecdub is now _ecdub.
    ecmul is now _ecmul.
    factorint now has the trialextra keyword argument.
    factorsieve is now a generator, and it starts at 1 instead of 0.
    frobenius_prp now requires the leading coefficient to be listed explicitly.
    gcd is now imported from math, rather than defined here.
    isqrt is now imported from math, rather than defined here.
    jacobi no longer checks that the modulus is a positive odd number.
    lcm is now imported from math, rather than defined here.
    mlucas is now _mlucas.
    mobiussieve is now a generator.
    partitions now has an optional keyword argument to make it compute the number of partitions into distinct parts, and the meaning of its parts keyword argument has changed.
    polyrootsmod is now a generator, and its output should not be expected to be sorted.
    primefac now has the trialextra keyword argument.
    primegen has been slightly optimized.
    primephi no longer has a keyword argument, and its third argument is now a 1-based list.
    primepi now uses the Lagarias-Miller-Odlyzko algorithm.  Its keyword arguments have changed.
    randomfactored now implements both Bach's and Kalai's algorithms.  For backwards compatibility, the latter is the default.  The primality test is no longer user-selectable.
    randprime returns None when asked to produce a prime with 1 digit in base 2, rather than entering an infinite loop.
    riemannR's default value for n is now (11 * ln(x) + 153) // 6.
    sqrtmod is now a generator, and its output should not be expected to be sorted.
    totientsieve is now a generator, and it has an optional second argument to make it compute the Jordan totient function.

New functions: dirichletcharacter, divsigmasieve, powerfulmap, pythags, rational_in_base, sqfrcount

Removals with replacement:
    binomial has been removed; instead, we have "from math import comb".
    iterprod has been removed; instead, we have "from math import prod".
    modinv has been removed; use pow(x, -1, y) instead of modinv(x, y).

Removals without replacement: arithmeticderivative, collatz, is_ngonal, isprime_mersenne, ngonal

Version 2.2.0:

Changed RPN behavior for /

---

Version 2.1.3:

Minor improvement to nearlyprimegen

---

Version 2.1.2:

Tweaked the README file.

---

Version 2.1.1:

Bugfix: almostprimegen in the case k == 1

---

Version 2.1.0:

New function: quadratic_scf
New function: semiprimegen
New function: pspgen
New function: almostprimegen
New function: nearlyprimegen

---

Version 2.0.2:

Improved README file.

---

Version 2.0.1:

Improved docstrings and README file.

---

Version 2.0.0:

Various improvements to various docstrings.

Modified function: nextprime and prevprime now have an optional argument to specify the primality test.  Default == isprime.

Modified function: if fed a finite parameter sequence, and if this fails to produce a factor, then ecm will return None.  This requires that nproc == 1.  The parameter sequence for the case where nprocs > 1 must still be infinite.

Improved function: primegen has been sped up by as much as 15%.

Deprecation: iterprod and binomial will be replaced with "from math import prod, comb" in some future version, and modinv will be removed since it can now be computed via pow(x, -1, y).

Removed function: mpqs
Removed function: fermat_prp

New function: siqs, as a replacement for the buggy mpqs.

---

Version 1.2.0:

Various improvements to various docstrings.

New function: polyval
New function: cbrtmod_prime
New function: polyroots_prime
New function: hensel
New function: polyrootsmod
New function: polyaddmodp
New function: polysubmodp
New function: polymulmodp
New function: polydivmodmodp
New function: gcmd
New function: polypowmodpmodpoly
New function: frobenius_prp

Deleted function: hensel_lift
Deleted function: hensel_lift_2
Deleted function: sqrtmod_primepow
This technically breaks backwards compatibility, suggesting that the new version number should be 2.0.0, but those were helper functions for sqrtmod and not intended to be called by the user, so I'm only incrementing the version to 1.2.0.

Bugfix: Docstrings claim that sqrtmod's output would be sorted.  It wasn't always so.  It is now.

---

Version 1.1.0:

New data: labmathversion

New function: liouville
New function: egypt_short
New function: egypt_greedy
New function: randomfactored
New function: secm
New function: ecmparams

Altered behavior: randprime's output is now uniformly sampled among all primes of the indicated size, and the primality test used is user-selectable.  Full backwards compatibility is preserved.
Altered behavior: ecm is now a shell function that calls secm repeatedly (which is where the factoring now happens) using parameters pulled from ecmparams.  Backwards compatibility is preserved in the positional arguments; backwards compatibility is broken for the keyword arguments.

---

Version 1.0.8:

Improved credits and a few docstrings.
Fixed a bug in which product was not imported from itertools.

---

Versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.7: fumbling around with PyPI.
