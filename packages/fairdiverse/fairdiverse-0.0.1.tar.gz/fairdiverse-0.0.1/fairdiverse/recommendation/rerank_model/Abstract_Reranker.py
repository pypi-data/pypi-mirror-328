           This function performs re-ranking of items for each user by incorporating a fairness regularization term
           (`minimax_reg`) that adjusts the ranking scores to promote fairness across groups. The re-ranked list of
           items is returned for each user.

           :param k: The number of top-ranked items to return for each user.
           :return: A list of re-ranked item indices for each user, with the top `k` items for each user.
