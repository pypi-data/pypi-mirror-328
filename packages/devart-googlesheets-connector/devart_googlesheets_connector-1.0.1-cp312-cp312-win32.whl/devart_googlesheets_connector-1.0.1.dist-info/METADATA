# Python Connector for Google Sheets #

Python Connector for Google Sheets is a connectivity solution for accessing
Google Sheets Customer Engagement (formerly Dynamics CRM) from Python
applications to read and update data. It fully implements the Python DB API
2.0 specification. The connector is distributed as a wheel package for Windows
and Windows Server.

Standard SQL syntax

The connector fully supports the ANSI SQL standard and lets you execute SQL
statements against your Google Sheets data just like you would normally work
with relational databases. Simple queries are directly converted to Google
Sheets API calls and executed on the Google Sheets side.
Complex queries are transformed into simpler queries, which are then converted
to Google Sheets API calls. The embedded SQL engine then processes the results
in the local cache and applies advanced SQL features from the original complex
query.

## Using the connector ##

To retrieve data from [!ProductNameMix]:

Import the module.
```
import devart.googlesheets as googlesheets
```

Connect to a database using the `connect()` module method and obtain a `connection` object.
```
response = googlesheets.signin()
my_spreadsheet = googlesheets.getspreadsheet("RefreshToken=" + response["Refresh Token"])
my_connection = googlesheets.connect(
    SpreadsheetId=my_spreadsheet["Spreadsheet Id"]
    RefreshToken=response["Refresh Token"]
)
```
Create a `cursor` object using the `cursor()` connection method.
```
my_cursor = my_connection.cursor()
```
Execute the SQL statement using the `execute()` cursor method.
```
my_cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Company")
```
Retrieve the result set using one of the `fetch*()` cursor methods.
```
for row in my_cursor.fetchall(): 
    print(row)
```
