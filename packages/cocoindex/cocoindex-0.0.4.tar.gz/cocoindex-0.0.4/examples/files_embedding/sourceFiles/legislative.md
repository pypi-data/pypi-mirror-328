The **legislative branch** of the United States is one of the three branches of the federal government, established by **Article I of the U.S. Constitution**. Its primary role is to create, debate, and pass laws. The legislative branch is **bicameral**, consisting of two chambers:

---

### 1. **The U.S. Congress**
Congress is the central body of the legislative branch and is divided into:

#### **a. The House of Representatives**
- **Membership**: 435 members, apportioned among the states based on population. States with larger populations have more representatives, while every state has at least one.
- **Term**: Representatives serve **2-year terms**, making this chamber closely tied to public opinion and frequent elections.
- **Eligibility**: Members must be at least **25 years old**, a **U.S. citizen for 7 years**, and a resident of the state they represent.
- **Leadership**: The **Speaker of the House**, elected by the members, is the presiding officer and plays a key role in setting the legislative agenda.

##### Powers Unique to the House:
- Initiating **revenue-raising bills** (tax legislation).
- **Impeaching** federal officials (bringing charges against them).

---

#### **b. The Senate**
- **Membership**: 100 members, with **two senators per state**, ensuring equal representation regardless of population size.
- **Term**: Senators serve **6-year terms**, with staggered elections so approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election every two years.
- **Eligibility**: Members must be at least **30 years old**, a **U.S. citizen for 9 years**, and a resident of the state they represent.
- **Leadership**: The **Vice President of the United States** serves as the President of the Senate and casts tie-breaking votes. The **President Pro Tempore**, a senior member of the majority party, presides in the Vice Presidentâ€™s absence.

##### Powers Unique to the Senate:
- **Confirming appointments** made by the President, including federal judges and Cabinet members.
- Ratifying **treaties** with a two-thirds vote.
- Holding **impeachment trials** and voting on whether to remove officials from office.

### 2. **Powers and Responsibilities of Congress**
The legislative branch has a broad range of responsibilities, including:

- **Making laws**: Drafting, debating, and passing legislation on various issues like taxation, defense, healthcare, and infrastructure.
- **Budget and Spending**: Controlling federal finances, including the power to levy taxes, borrow money, and allocate government spending.
- **Oversight**: Monitoring and investigating the executive branch and federal agencies to ensure they act within the law and fulfill their duties responsibly.
- **Declaring war**: While the President is the Commander-in-Chief, only Congress has the power to formally declare war.

---

### 3. **The Legislative Process**
- **Proposal**: Bills can be introduced in either the House or Senate (except revenue bills, which start in the House).
- **Committee Review**: Bills are reviewed, amended, and debated in committees.
- **Debate and Voting**: After committee approval, bills are debated and voted on by the full chamber.
- **Reconciliation**: If both chambers pass different versions of a bill, a **conference committee** resolves discrepancies.
- **Presidential Action**: The President can sign the bill into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without a signature after 10 days if Congress is in session.

---

### 4. **Checks and Balances**
The legislative branch operates within a system of **checks and balances**:
- It can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds vote in both chambers.
- It approves appointments and treaties negotiated by the executive branch.
- It has the power to impeach and remove officials, including the President and judges.

This structure ensures that the legislative branch collaborates with, but also monitors, the executive and judicial branches to maintain a balance of power.
