The **judicial branch** of the United States is one of the three branches of government established by the U.S. Constitution, alongside the legislative and executive branches. Its primary role is to interpret and apply the law, ensuring justice and the constitutional principles are upheld. Hereâ€™s an overview of its structure, powers, and functions:

### **Structure of the Judicial Branch**
1. **Supreme Court**:
   - The highest court in the land, established by Article III of the Constitution.
   - Composed of nine justices, including one Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices.
   - The Supreme Court has the authority to hear cases of great national importance or those involving constitutional questions.

2. **Lower Federal Courts**:
   - Created by Congress under Article III.
   - Divided into:
     - **District Courts**: Trial courts where most federal cases begin.
     - **Circuit Courts of Appeals**: Review decisions from district courts and administrative agencies.

3. **Specialized Courts**:
   - Include courts like the U.S. Tax Court, Court of Federal Claims, and Bankruptcy Courts, which handle specific types of cases.

### **Powers and Responsibilities**
1. **Judicial Review**:
   - The judicial branch has the authority to determine whether laws or executive actions are constitutional. 
   - This power was established through the landmark case *Marbury v. Madison* (1803).

2. **Interpretation of Laws**:
   - Judges interpret statutes, treaties, and regulations, resolving ambiguities or conflicts in the law.

3. **Application of Law to Cases**:
   - The courts resolve disputes by applying federal and state laws to individual cases.

4. **Protection of Rights**:
   - The judicial branch safeguards individual rights and liberties by ensuring governmental actions comply with the Constitution.

### **Independence of the Judiciary**
To ensure fairness and impartiality:
- **Lifetime Appointments**: Federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, serve for life unless they resign, retire, or are removed through impeachment.
- **Salary Protections**: Judges' salaries cannot be reduced during their tenure, preventing financial influence.

### **Limitations**
- **No Enforcement Power**: The judiciary relies on the executive branch to enforce its decisions.
- **Dependent on Cases**: Courts can only rule on cases brought before them; they do not proactively create or investigate laws.

### **Impact and Importance**
The judicial branch plays a crucial role in maintaining the rule of law, balancing the powers of the other branches, and protecting the principles of democracy by ensuring all laws and actions conform to the Constitution. Through landmark decisions such as *Brown v. Board of Education* (civil rights), *Roe v. Wade* (privacy rights), and *Obergefell v. Hodges* (marriage equality), the judiciary has significantly shaped U.S. society and governance.
