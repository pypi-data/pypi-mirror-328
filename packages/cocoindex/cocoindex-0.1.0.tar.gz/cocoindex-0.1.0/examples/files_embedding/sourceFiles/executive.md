### **Checks and Balances**
The executive branch is part of the U.S. government's system of checks and balances:
- Congress (legislative branch) can override a presidential veto with a two-thirds majority.
- The judiciary (judicial branch) can declare executive actions unconstitutional.
- The Senate must approve key presidential appointments and treaties.

This structure ensures that the executive branch operates within the framework of the Constitution while providing dynamic leadership for the country.
