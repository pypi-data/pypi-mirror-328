**CocoIndex is an understandable, scalable, maintainable cloud-native infra to prepare your data for semantic search/RAG, with lineage and observability.**

What we can help is connecting to all the data sources (can be per tenant),  helping you identify/setup the best indexing strategy & pipeline (chunking, embedding model, deduping/reconciling, vector stores, knowledge graph), and providing standard API.  Building the state of art and robust base for indexing is what we really excel at. So you can focus on building your application with a robust base, and not worry about scalability, reliability etc.  

## Setup Backend Locally

### Prerequisites

1.  Install Docker Compose: [docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2.  Install rust toolchain: [docs](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install)

3.  Install `poetry`: [docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

4.  Start a Postgres SQL database for cocoindex. For development purpose, you can bring this up by docker compose:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Run the development server:

### (Optional) Setup and activate python virtual environment

```bash
virtualenv --python=$(which python3.12) .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
```

### Build the library

Run the following commands:

```bash
poetry install
maturin develop
```

### Extra trace for engine debugging (optional)

Run the following command to set extra environment variables, to debug the cocoindex library, for exposing extra traces, allowing dev UI, etc.

```bash
. .env.lib_debug
```

### Run a specific example

Then cd into any example directory and run a specific example.
