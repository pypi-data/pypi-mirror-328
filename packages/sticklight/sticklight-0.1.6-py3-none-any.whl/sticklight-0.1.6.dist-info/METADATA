# Sticklight Python SDK

The official Python SDK for [Sticklight](https://sticklight.io).

## Installation

```bash
pip install sticklight
```

## Quick Start

```python
import sticklight as sl

# Publish an event
sl.capture({
    "event_name": "user_message",
    "user_id": "user_123",
    "message": "I need help with this and that feature",
    ...  # Any other data you want to track
})
```

## Authentication

You'll need a Sticklight API key to use this SDK. You can either:

1. Set it as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export STICKLIGHT_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

2. Pass it directly to the capture function:
   ```python
   sl.capture(data, sticklight_api_key="your-api-key")
   ```

To get your API key, go to the [Sticklight Platform] and create a new key.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
