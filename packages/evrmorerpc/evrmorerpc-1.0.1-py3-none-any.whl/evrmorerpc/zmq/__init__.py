"""ZMQ module for subscribing to Evrmore node notifications

This module provides a high-level interface for subscribing to ZeroMQ notifications from an Evrmore node.
It handles the complexity of ZMQ socket management, async operations, and thread safety.

Example usage:
    ```python
    import asyncio
    from rpc.zmq import EvrmoreZMQ
    
    # Create ZMQ client
    zmq_client = EvrmoreZMQ()
    
    # Define handlers for different notification types
    async def handle_tx(notification: ZMQNotification):
        tx_hash = notification.body.hex()
        print(f"New transaction: {tx_hash}")
    
    async def handle_block(notification: ZMQNotification):
        block_hash = notification.body.hex()
        print(f"New block: {block_hash}")
    
    # Subscribe to notifications
    zmq_client.subscribe([b"hashtx"], handle_tx)
    zmq_client.subscribe([b"hashblock"], handle_block)
    
    # Start listening (this will block until interrupted)
    try:
        asyncio.run(zmq_client.start())
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        zmq_client.close()
    ```

Available ZMQ topics:
    - hashtx: New transaction hashes
    - rawtx: New transactions in raw format
    - hashblock: New block hashes
    - rawblock: New blocks in raw format
    - sequence: Sequence notifications for chain reorganizations

Configuration:
    The module reads ZMQ endpoints from evrmore.conf using the following settings:
    - zmqpubhashtx: Endpoint for transaction hash notifications
    - zmqpubrawtx: Endpoint for raw transaction notifications
    - zmqpubhashblock: Endpoint for block hash notifications
    - zmqpubrawblock: Endpoint for raw block notifications
    - zmqpubsequence: Endpoint for sequence notifications

Thread Safety:
    This module is designed to be thread-safe and can handle both synchronous and
    asynchronous callbacks. It uses a queue-based system to safely pass notifications
    from ZMQ threads to the async event loop.
