# **facetrackr** üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüé•  
_A Face Recognition and Timestamp Extraction Tool for Videos_

## **Overview**  
**facetrackr** is a Python package that allows users to detect and recognize faces in videos using AWS Rekognition. It provides a seamless way to upload face images to a collection, process videos, and retrieve timestamps where the face is detected.

## **Features**
‚úÖ Add a face image to an AWS Rekognition collection  
‚úÖ Process a video to detect the given face  
‚úÖ Retrieve timestamps of face appearances  
‚úÖ Easy-to-use command-line interface  

---

## **Installation**  

Ensure you have Python **3.7+** installed. Then install `facetrackr` using:

```sh
pip install facetrackr
```

---

## **Usage**
After installing, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python -m facetrackr
```

You will be prompted to enter:
1. The **path of the face image** you want to recognize.
2. The **path of the video** in which you want to detect the face.

### **Example**
```
Enter the path of the face image: ./images/person.jpg
Enter the path of the video: ./videos/sample.mp4
```
If the face is found in the video, the output will be:

```
Starting face detection in video...

Final Detection Report:
Face detected at 12.5 seconds with ID: person_123
Face detected at 28.7 seconds with ID: person_123
```

---

## **Demo Code**
You can also integrate `facetrackr` into your own Python script. Below is an example demonstrating how to use the package:

```python
from facetrackr.face_collection import FaceCollection
from facetrackr.video_processing import VideoProcessor

def main():
    face_image_path = input("Enter the path of the face image: ").strip()
    video_path = input("Enter the path of the video: ").strip()

    # Initialize face collection handler
    face_collection = FaceCollection()
    
    # Add face to AWS Rekognition collection
    face_id, external_image_id = face_collection.add_face(face_image_path)

    if face_id:
        print("\nStarting face detection in video...\n")

        # Initialize video processor
        video_processor = VideoProcessor()
        detection_results = video_processor.process_video(video_path, external_image_id)

        print("\nFinal Detection Report:")
        for detection in detection_results:
            print(f"Face detected at {detection['timestamp']} seconds with ID: {detection['external_image_id']}")
    else:
        print("Face was not added to collection. Exiting.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## **Requirements**
Before running the package, install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **AWS Configuration**
Since this package relies on AWS Rekognition, ensure you have:
1. An **AWS account** with Rekognition enabled.
2. **AWS credentials** configured using:
   ```sh
   aws configure
   ```
3. The necessary permissions in IAM for Rekognition.
