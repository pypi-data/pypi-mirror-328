# CodeJump

CodeJump is a fun Python library that allows for controlled execution of code with checkpoints and teleportation. It enables users to jump to specific points in the code, run particular segments as needed, and execute code step-by-step.

## Features
It is just a fun library, not very efficient. 
- **checkpoint**: Register points in the code to "jump" to.
- **teleport_to**: Jump to specific checkpoints during execution.
- **jumprun**: Execute code step by step while managing jumps.


## Installation

You can install **CodeJump** via pip:
```bash
pip install codejump
```
## Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use CodeJump in your Python scripts:
checkpoints and teleports can be used only in a function and ```jumprun(func_name)``` should be used to execute the function. 

```python
from codejump import checkpoint, teleport_to, jumprun

def main():
    checkpoint("start")
    print("Inside Start")
    teleport_to("end")
    
    #the code below gets skipped
    checkpoint("middle")
    print("Inside Middle")
    teleport_to("end")
    #the code above gets skipped
    
    checkpoint("end")
    print("Inside End")

jumprun(main)



```
Outputs:
```
 Inside Start
 Inside End
```
