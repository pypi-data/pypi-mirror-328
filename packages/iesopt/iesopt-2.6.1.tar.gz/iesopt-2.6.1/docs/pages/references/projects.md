### Project Slug Title

Consider the following:

- If possible link to an `ait.ac.at` subpage for `homepage`.
- Project slug might be `HyTechonomy`, with the full title being `Hydrogen Technologies for Sustainable Economies`, then the link target (the thing above the slug title `(references-projects-project-slug-title)=`) would then be `(references-projects-hytechonomy)=`.
- Replace the `funding` information accordingly.
