Cpppo_positioner is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3
and is also available under alternative licenses negotiated directly with Hard
Consulting Corporation. If you obtained Cpppo_positioner under the GPL, then the
GPL applies to all Cpppo_positioner modules used on your system as well, except
as defined below. The GPL (version 3) is included in this source tree in the
file COPYING.

Hard Consulting Corporation holds copyright and/or sufficient licenses to all
components of the Cpppo_positioner package, and therefore can grant, at its sole
discretion, the ability for companies, individuals, or organizations to create
proprietary or Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may use at runtime
the portions of Cpppo_positioner which fall under our copyright/license
umbrella, or are distributed under more flexible licenses than GPL.

If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry -- there is no
requirement that you provide the same exception in your GPL'd products (although
if you've written a module for Cpppo_positioner we would strongly encourage you
to make the same exception that we do).

In addition to positioning actuator control, Cpppo_positioner implements other
communications protocols.  It is our belief that applications using these
protocols to manage or control a Cpppo_positioner instance do not have to be
licensed under the GPL or a compatible license, as we believe these protocols do
not create a 'derivative work' as referred to in the GPL.  However, should any
court or other judiciary body find that these protocols do fall under the terms
of the GPL, then we hereby grant you a license to use these protocols in
combination with Cpppo_positioner in external applications licensed under any
license you wish.
