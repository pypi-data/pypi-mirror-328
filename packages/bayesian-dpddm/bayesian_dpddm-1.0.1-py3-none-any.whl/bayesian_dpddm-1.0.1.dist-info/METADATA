# Bayesian D-PDDM

Bayesian implementation of the D-PDDM algorithm for post-deployment deterioration monitoring. Bayesian D-PDDM is a Bayesian approximation to the D-PDDM algorithm which provably monitors model deterioration at deployment time. Bayesian D-PDDM:

- Flags deteriorating shifts in the unsupervised deployment data distribution
- Resists flagging non-deteriorating shifts, unlike classical OOD detection leveraging distances and/or metrics between data distributions.
