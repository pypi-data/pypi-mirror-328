# gs_ml_tooklit

The **gs_ml_tooklit** is a library developed for standardizing and streamlining internal projects for the GreenShare Experiments team. This package provides a suite of tools to associate directional information with public transport data, specifically for occupancy (crowding) and evasion data provided by public transport companies. It also provides a GTFS processor class that enables the user to merge different GTFS files into one to later use it with the direction processing function.

## Installation

You can install the package from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
pip install gs_ml_tooklit
```

For testing and development, you can also install it from TestPyPI:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ gs_ml_tooklit
```
## Running Tests

The package includes tests to verify functionality and ensure code quality. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. **Install Testing Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have `pytest` and `pytest-cov` installed:
   
   ```bash
   pip install pytest pytest-cov
   ```

2. **Run Tests:**

   From the root directory of the project, run:
   
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=gs_ml_tooklit --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

   This command runs all tests and shows a coverage report in the terminal.
