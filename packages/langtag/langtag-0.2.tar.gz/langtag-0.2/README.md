# Language Tags

The language tags project maintains a comprehensive list of language tags
in equivalences sets, where a list of language tags are considered equivalent
semantically.

The content for each language tag set includes names and equivalent regions.
Names are curated to ensure no pejorative names, as far as possible.

There is a python module available for accessing the langtags.json file and
making the information available as well as keeping a locally cached version.
