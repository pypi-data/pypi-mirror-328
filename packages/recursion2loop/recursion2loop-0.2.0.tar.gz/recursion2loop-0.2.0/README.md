## Features

- ðŸ”„ Convert recursive functions to iterative implementations
- ðŸ”§ Type-safe implementations with full typing support

## Installation

pip install recursion2loop
```

## Available Transformations

- Tree Traversals (check for more details: [tree traversal documentation](documentation/doc_tree_traversal.md))
- Tree Operations (check for more details: [tree operations documentation](documentation/doc_tree_operations.md))
