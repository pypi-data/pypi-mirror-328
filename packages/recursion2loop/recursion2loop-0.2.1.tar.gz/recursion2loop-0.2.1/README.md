This package provides common recursive patterns to iterative implementations. The goal is to provide stack-safe and memory-efficient iterative implementations in python language.

## Features

- ðŸ”„ Convert recursive functions to iterative implementations
- ðŸ”§ Type-safe implementations with full typing support

## Installation

```bash
pip install recursion2loop
```
