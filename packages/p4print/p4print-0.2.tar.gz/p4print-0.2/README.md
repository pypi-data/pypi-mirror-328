## p4print
Earlier, I was a Java lover. In Java, I writing System.out.print() again and again was frustrating. So, I used sop() instead.

When I started coding in Python, my lazy coder instincts kicked inâ€”I wanted a simpler way to print output. Typing print() repeatedly slowed me down, so I created a lightweight package that lets you use p() instead of print().

## usage
```sh
from lazyprint import p
p("Hello, World!")

## Installation
```sh
pip install lazyprint
