# Win_purge

It is a very bad idea to run Python code from the internet that modifies the Windows Registry.  Minor bugs in Win_purge can be critical - any could inadvertantly cripple your system.  Win_purge can delete important registry keys if you let it - I do not know the purpose of every Registry key, and there is no special treatment of any Windows edition or setups (the code can quickly become out of date - the frequency of automatic Windows updates in the modern age, means Win_purge could have become inadvertantly unsafe at any point in time).  

I draw your attention to the last paragraph of the MIT license:

"THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR

That said, if you accept the risk, then win_purge has been designed to take the following steps to protect your system, based on a simple text search:

 - Refuses to run if a matching registered uninstaller is found (as this should be run instead).
 - Uses exactly the same search code for a safe dry run, as for a run that deletes matching keys - no surprising results.
 - Requires a special force switch on the CLI to delete and modify keys.
 - Prompts for confirmation, skip or quit (y/n/quit respectively) before each change.
 - Tries to identify system path keys.  In recognised path keys, win_purge modifies the path name/data in the value instead (removing matching paths from the system wide path and from the user's path).  
 - Backs up each key before modification or deletion (with `reg export`[^0]), and consolidates the backups after each session.
 - Uses send2trash to send the temporary key back up files to the Recycle Bin (does not permanently delete them).

 - Win_purge can also delete matching application files from common installation directories.
