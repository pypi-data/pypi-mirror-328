    """
    Singleton class responsible for managing the loading and execution of commands within the framework.

    This class ensures that commands are loaded only once and are accessible for execution. It is designed to follow
    the Singleton pattern, meaning only one instance of this class will exist in the application lifecycle.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _instance : CLICache
        The singleton instance of the CLICache class.
    _lock : threading.Lock
        A lock used to ensure thread-safety during instance creation.
    _initialized : bool
        A flag indicating whether the class has been initialized.
    paths : list
        List of directories where commands are located.

    Methods
    -------
    __new__ :
        Creates and returns the singleton instance of the CLICache class.
    __init__ :
        Initializes the CLICache instance, loading commands if not already initialized.
    _load_commands :
        Loads command modules from predefined directories and imports them dynamically.
    getCommands :
        Returns the instance of CacheCommands containing the command cache.
