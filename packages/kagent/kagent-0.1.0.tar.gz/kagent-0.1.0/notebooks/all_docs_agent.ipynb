For example:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\n$ istioctl ztunnel-config workloads\\\\nNAMESPACE    POD NAME                                IP         NODE                     WAYPOINT PROTOCOL\\\\ndefault      details-v1-857849f66-ft8wx              10.42.0.5  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\\\ndefault      kubernetes                              172.20.0.3                          None     TCP\\\\ndefault      productpage-v1-c5b7f7dbc-hlhpd          10.42.0.8  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\\\ndefault      ratings-v1-68d5f5486b-b5sbj             10.42.0.6  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\\\ndefault      reviews-v1-7dc5fc4b46-ndrq9             10.42.1.5  k3d-k3s-default-agent-1  None     HBONE\\\\ndefault      reviews-v2-6cf45d556b-4k4md             10.42.0.7  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\\\ndefault      reviews-v3-86cb7d97f8-zxzl4             10.42.1.6  k3d-k3s-default-agent-1  None     HBONE\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nHaving HBONE configured on your workload doesn’t mean your workload will reject any plaintext traffic. If you want your workload to reject plaintext traffic, create a `PeerAuthentication` policy with mTLS mode set to `STRICT` for your workload.\\\\n\\\\nValidate mTLS from metrics\\\\n--------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIf you have installed Prometheus, you can set up port-forwarding and open the Prometheus UI by using the following command:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\n$ istioctl dashboard prometheus\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIn Prometheus, you can view the values for the TCP metrics. First, select Graph and enter the a metric such as: `istio_tcp_connections_opened_total`, `istio_tcp_connections_closed_total`, `istio_tcp_received_bytes_total`, or `istio_tcp_sent_bytes_total`. Lastly, click Execute. The data will contain entries such as:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\nistio_tcp_connections_opened_total{\\\\n  app=\"ztunnel\",\\\\n  connection_security_policy=\"mutual_tls\",\\\\n  destination_principal=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-details\",\\\\n  destination_service=\"details.default.svc.cluster.local\",\\\\n  reporter=\"source\",\\\\n  request_protocol=\"tcp\",\\\\n  response_flags=\"-\",\\\\n  source_app=\"curl\",\\\\n  source_principal=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/curl\",source_workload_namespace=\"default\",\\\\n  ...}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nValidate that the `connection_security_policy` value is set to `mutual_tls` along with the expected source and destination identity information.\\\\n\\\\nValidate mTLS from logs\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nYou can also view either the source or destination ztunnel log to confirm mTLS is enabled, along with peer identities. Below is an example of the source ztunnel’s log for a request from the `curl` service to the `details` service:\\\\n\\\\n```yaml\\\\n2024-08-21T15:32:05.754291Z info access connection complete src.addr=10.42.0.9:33772 src.workload=\"curl-7656cf8794-6lsm4\" src.namespace=\"default\"\\\\nsrc.identity=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/curl\" dst.addr=10.42.0.5:15008 dst.hbone_addr=10.42.0.5:9080 dst.service=\"details.default.svc.cluster.local\"\\\\ndst.workload=\"details-v1-857849f66-ft8wx\" dst.namespace=\"default\" dst.identity=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-details\"\\\\ndirection=\"outbound\" bytes_sent=84 bytes_recv=358 duration=\"15ms\"\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nValidate the `src.identity` and `dst.identity` values are correct. They are the identities used for the mTLS communication among the source and destination workloads. Refer to the verifying ztunnel traffic through logs section for more details.\\\\n\\\\nValidate with Kiali dashboard\\\\n-----------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIf you have Kiali and Prometheus installed, you can visualize your workload communication in the ambient mesh using Kiali’s dashboard. You can see if the connection between any workloads has the padlock icon to validate that mTLS is enabled, along with the peer identity information:\\\\n\\\\n[](/latest/docs/ambient/usage/verify-mtls-enabled/kiali-mtls.png)\\\\n\\\\nKiali dashboard\\\\n\\\\nRefer to the Visualize the application and metrics document for more details.\\\\n\\\\nValidate with `tcpdump`\\\\n-----------------------\\\\n\\\\nIf you have access to your Kubernetes worker nodes, you can run the `tcpdump` command to capture all traffic on the network interface, with optional focusing the application ports and HBONE port. In this example, port `9080` \\'}]', call_id='call_OTifhhMG9Em7Mjgnlb0YfFin'), FunctionExecutionResult(content='[{\\'distance\\': 0.9615646600723267, \\'content\\': \\'\\\\nTLS and authentication are currently being rolled out to the Prometheus, Alertmanager, and the official exporters.

For example:\\n\\n```yaml\\n$ istioctl ztunnel-config workloads\\nNAMESPACE    POD NAME                                IP         NODE                     WAYPOINT PROTOCOL\\ndefault      details-v1-857849f66-ft8wx              10.42.0.5  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\ndefault      kubernetes                              172.20.0.3                          None     TCP\\ndefault      productpage-v1-c5b7f7dbc-hlhpd          10.42.0.8  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\ndefault      ratings-v1-68d5f5486b-b5sbj             10.42.0.6  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\ndefault      reviews-v1-7dc5fc4b46-ndrq9             10.42.1.5  k3d-k3s-default-agent-1  None     HBONE\\ndefault      reviews-v2-6cf45d556b-4k4md             10.42.0.7  k3d-k3s-default-agent-0  None     HBONE\\ndefault      reviews-v3-86cb7d97f8-zxzl4             10.42.1.6  k3d-k3s-default-agent-1  None     HBONE\\n```\\n\\nHaving HBONE configured on your workload doesn’t mean your workload will reject any plaintext traffic. If you want your workload to reject plaintext traffic, create a `PeerAuthentication` policy with mTLS mode set to `STRICT` for your workload.\\n\\nValidate mTLS from metrics\\n--------------------------\\n\\nIf you have installed Prometheus, you can set up port-forwarding and open the Prometheus UI by using the following command:\\n\\n```yaml\\n$ istioctl dashboard prometheus\\n```\\n\\nIn Prometheus, you can view the values for the TCP metrics. First, select Graph and enter the a metric such as: `istio_tcp_connections_opened_total`, `istio_tcp_connections_closed_total`, `istio_tcp_received_bytes_total`, or `istio_tcp_sent_bytes_total`. Lastly, click Execute. The data will contain entries such as:\\n\\n```yaml\\nistio_tcp_connections_opened_total{\\n  app=\"ztunnel\",\\n  connection_security_policy=\"mutual_tls\",\\n  destination_principal=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-details\",\\n  destination_service=\"details.default.svc.cluster.local\",\\n  reporter=\"source\",\\n  request_protocol=\"tcp\",\\n  response_flags=\"-\",\\n  source_app=\"curl\",\\n  source_principal=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/curl\",source_workload_namespace=\"default\",\\n  ...}\\n```\\n\\nValidate that the `connection_security_policy` value is set to `mutual_tls` along with the expected source and destination identity information.\\n\\nValidate mTLS from logs\\n-----------------------\\n\\nYou can also view either the source or destination ztunnel log to confirm mTLS is enabled, along with peer identities. Below is an example of the source ztunnel’s log for a request from the `curl` service to the `details` service:\\n\\n```yaml\\n2024-08-21T15:32:05.754291Z info access connection complete src.addr=10.42.0.9:33772 src.workload=\"curl-7656cf8794-6lsm4\" src.namespace=\"default\"\\nsrc.identity=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/curl\" dst.addr=10.42.0.5:15008 dst.hbone_addr=10.42.0.5:9080 dst.service=\"details.default.svc.cluster.local\"\\ndst.workload=\"details-v1-857849f66-ft8wx\" dst.namespace=\"default\" dst.identity=\"spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-details\"\\ndirection=\"outbound\" bytes_sent=84 bytes_recv=358 duration=\"15ms\"\\n```\\n\\nValidate the `src.identity` and `dst.identity` values are correct. They are the identities used for the mTLS communication among the source and destination workloads. Refer to the verifying ztunnel traffic through logs section for more details.\\n\\nValidate with Kiali dashboard\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nIf you have Kiali and Prometheus installed, you can visualize your workload communication in the ambient mesh using Kiali’s dashboard. You can see if the connection between any workloads has the padlock icon to validate that mTLS is enabled, along with the peer identity information:\\n\\n[](/latest/docs/ambient/usage/verify-mtls-enabled/kiali-mtls.png)\\n\\nKiali dashboard\\n\\nRefer to the Visualize the application and metrics document for more details.\\n\\nValidate with `tcpdump`\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIf you have access to your Kubernetes worker nodes, you can run the `tcpdump` command to capture all traffic on the network interface, with optional focusing the application ports and HBONE port. In this example, port `9080` '}]\n",

      "- **TLS Configuration in Prometheus:** For environments using `STRICT` mTLS mode, ensure that Prometheus is configured with Istio provided certificates. This involves setting up appropriate certificates and possibly sidecar injection as described in Istio's documentation link [here](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/observability/metrics/querying-metrics/).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Authentication Policies:** Ensure that correct authentication policies and destination rules are in place, fostering smooth mTLS operations. For details see the Istio [mTLS guide](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/mtls-migration/).\n",
