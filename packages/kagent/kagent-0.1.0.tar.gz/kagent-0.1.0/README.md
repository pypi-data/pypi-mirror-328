## Prerequisites
- Python
- [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- Open AI API key

## Running python code

First we build and install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

Once the dependencies are installed, a good first step is to check out the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory.
I recommend installing the JupyterLab extension for VSCode to run the notebooks. The necessary packages will be installed automatically by the command above.
