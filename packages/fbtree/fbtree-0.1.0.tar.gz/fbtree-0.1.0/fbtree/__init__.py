"""
FiberTree: A path-oriented database for storing and analyzing sequential decision paths.

FiberTree helps you track, analyze and optimize sequential decision processes by storing 
decision paths (fibers) and their outcomes.

Basic usage:
    from fbtree import FiberTree, Move
    
    # Create a tree
    tree = FiberTree()
    
    # Start building a path
    tree.start_path()
    
    # Add moves to the path
    tree.add_move(Move(1))
    tree.add_move(Move(2))
    tree.add_move(Move(3))
    
    # Record the outcome
    tree.record_outcome('win')
    
    # Get statistics
    stats = tree.get_statistics()
