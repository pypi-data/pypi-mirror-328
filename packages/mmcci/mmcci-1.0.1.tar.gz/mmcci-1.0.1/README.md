**MMCCI** is a fast and lightweight Python package for integrating and visualizing CCI networks within and between multiple platforms at the level of the individual LR pair. It works on **scRNA-seq** and **spatial transcriptomics** data samples that have been processed through the following CCI algorithms:
1. stLearn
2. CellChat
3. CellPhoneDB
4. NATMI
5. Squidpy

## Getting Started

### Installation

MMCCI can be installed with `pip`

```
pip install mmcci
```


### Documentation

Documentation and Tutorials are available here and we are commited to maintaining the software and addressing issues raised by users.

- There is a brain aging tutorial notebook [here](examples/brain_aging_example.ipynb)
- There is a melanoma tutorial notebook [here](examples/melanoma_example.ipynb)
- To understand how to load CCI results from different tools, look at this notebook [here](examples/loading_CCI_results.ipynb)

## CCI Integration

MMCCI allows users to integrate multiple CCI results together, both:
1. Samples from a single platform (eg. Visium)
2. Samples from multiple platforms (eg. Visium, Xenium and CosMX)

## CCI Analysis

MMCCI provides multiple useful analyses that can be run on the integrated networks or from a single sample:
1. Network comparison between groups with permutation testing
2. CLustering of LR pairs with similar networks
3. Clustering of spots/cells with similar interaction scores
4. Sender-receiver LR querying
5. GSEA pathway analysis
