Welcome to IceNet's documentation!
======================================

IceNet is a free, open-source ecosystem for sea ice forecasting that provides the ability to
download, process, train and predict from end to end.

Users can interact with IceNet either via the Python interface or via a set of command-line
interfaces (CLI) which provides a high-level interface.

.. note::

   IceNet is under heavy development and subject to architectural change with the next few
   releases.
   API stability is not guaranteed.
