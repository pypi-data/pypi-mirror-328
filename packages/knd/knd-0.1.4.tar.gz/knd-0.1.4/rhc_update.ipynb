Introduction\\n\\nThe Government of Punjab has launched a project for service improvement in rural areas of the\\nPunjab through Punjab Rural Municipal Services Company (PRMSC) which has been\\nestablished under Section 42 of Companies Act 2017. Through various studies, it has been\\nproven that poor condition of WASH not only affects the health of masses, but it also adversely\\naffects the economic growth of the region. Recently, a number of mega initiatives have been\\nlaunched by the Government, and international organizations in the urban areas of all provinces\\nof Pakistan for the improvement of water and sanitation but the rural areas still remain\\nneglected. Rural settlements of Punjab, which hold 73 % the province’s population living in\\n23,000 revenue villages, are in dire need for investments to improve WASH.\\n\\nOutcomes of Pre-Feasibility Studies (PFS) and sector assessments, have identified\\nrequirements for improving climate resilience and planned economic growth of 2,000 villages\\nwhich will be the part of the project. A typical Revenue Village comprises one or more large\\nsettlements and some scattered, small, and remote habitations. Due to the gravity of the\\nsituation, the Government of the Punjab, has endorsed selection of these 2,000 revenue\\nvillages, including 2009 large and 8000 small habitations for the water supply, sanitation and\\nsolid waste management interventions to the both large and small settlements to ensure that\\nthe poorest and remotely located residents are not left behind. Poverty, water contamination,\\nstunting and sanitation condition of the areas have been taken as basic parameters for selection\\nof project sites / tehsils. Over 6.0 million rural residents shall be served under the said\\ncomponent including Multi-village water supply scheme & 100% solid waste through recycling,\\ncomposting and management of residual waste. The interventions shall be implemented in\\nphased manner\\n\\nGovernment of Punjab, with the assistance of World Bank, will finance complete detailed\\nengineering designs through Engineering, Design & Supervision Consultancy Services (EDCS)\\nunder project in revenue villages of following Tehsils of Geographical based Clusters of\\nselected districts given hereunder. The services will assist in; (i) design documentation,\\nincluding Sub-scheme/Project Document (PC-I), Bill of Quantities, for water supply and\\nsanitation services to achieve economies of scale and desired results, operational and business\\nmodels and (ii) resident supervision of infrastructure development in below mentioned revenue\\nvillage covering all settlements:\\n\\n**Names/Number**\\n\\n**No. of Revenue**\\n\\n**Sr. #** **Districts**\\n\\n**Tehsils** **Villages covering all**\\n\\n**settlements**\\n\\n**South - II**\\n1 Muzaffargarh Ali Pur 114\\n2 Multan Shujabad 71\\n3 DG Khan Taunsa 183\\n**TOTAL =** **368**\\n\\n###### 73 | P a g e\\n\\n|Sr. #|Districts|Names/Number|Col4|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|||Tehsils|No. of Revenue Villages covering all settlements|\\n|South - II||||\\n|1|Muzaffargarh|Ali Pur|114|\\n|2|Multan|Shujabad|71|\\n|3|DG Khan|Taunsa|183|\\n|TOTAL =|||368|\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n\\nAll the relevant details along with coordinates are given in Annex – I.\\n\\n###### 2.
