# This YAML file configures the training of a 1 or 6-hourly state-in-state-out Crossformer model
# on NSF NCAR high-performance computing systems (casper.ucar.edu and derecho.hpc.ucar.edu).
# 
# The model is trained on 6-hourly ERA5 model-level data, incorporating key physical features:
# - Input: Model-level variables [U, V, T, Q], static variables [Z_GDS4_SFC, LSM], and dynamic forcing [tsi].
# - Output: 
#     - Model level: [U, V, T, Q]
#     - Single level: [SP, t2m]
#     - 500 hPa level: [U, V, T, Z, Q]
#
# This configuration is designed for fine-tuning and prediction tasks using advanced components, 
# such as spectral normalization, reflective padding, and tracer-specific postprocessing.
#
# Ensure compatibility with ERA5 data preprocessing workflows and metadata paths specified in this file.
