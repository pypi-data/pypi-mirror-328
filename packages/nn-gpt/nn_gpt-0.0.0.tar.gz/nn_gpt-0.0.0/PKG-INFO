<h3>Overview ðŸ“–</h3>

This Python-based project leverages large language models to automate the creation of neural network architectures, streamlining the design process for machine learning practitioners.

## Update of NN Dataset
Remove old version of the LEMUR Dataset and its database:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip uninstall nn-dataset -y
rm -rf db
```
Installing the stable version:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install nn-dataset --upgrade --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```
Installing from GitHub to get the most recent code and statistics updates:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-dataset --upgrade --force --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```
Adding functionality to export data to Excel files and generate plots for <a href='https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-stat'>analyzing neural network performance</a>:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install nn-stat --upgrade --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```
and export/generate:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m ab.stat.export
```

## Environment for NN Gen Developers
### Pip package manager
Create a virtual environment, activate it, and run the following command to install all the project dependencies:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

### Docker
All versions of this project are compatible with <a href='https://hub.docker.com/r/abrainone/ai-linux' target='_blank'>AI Linux</a> and can be run inside a Docker image:
```bash
docker run -v /a/mm:. abrainone/ai-linux bash -c "PYTHONPATH=/a/mm python -m ab.gen.train_n_eval"
```
