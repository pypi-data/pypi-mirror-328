Data Fetcher Module
====================

This module provides a class for fetching various types of data from 31 output data tables managed by the DataManager.
It is designed to facilitate easy access and retrieval of data across different environmental impact scenarios.

Classes
-------
DataFetcher
    A class responsible for retrieving data from the output tables, offering methods to access specific types of data
    related to livestock, crops, land use, climate change, air quality, and eutrophication.

Dependencies
------------
- DataManager

Usage
-----
Initialize the DataFetcher class and use its methods to retrieve data from various output tables. The retrieved data
can be used for analysis, comparison, and visualization of environmental impacts across different scenarios.

Methods
-------
    - get_scenario_inputs(): Retrieves scenario input data.
    - get_stocking_rate_per_ha(): Fetches stocking rate per hectare data.
    - get_grassland_spared_area_by_soil_group(): Retrieves spared (destocked) grassland area data by soil group.

    - get_landuse_areas(): Retrieves data on land use areas for each scenario and the baseline.
    - dump_tables(data_path): Dumps all tables to a specified path.

Each method in the DataFetcher class is designed to retrieve a specific type of data from the output tables managed by the DataManager. The methods return pandas DataFrames containing relevant data, which can be further analyzed or visualized as required.

The DataFetcher class streamlines the process of data retrieval from complex environmental impact models, making it easier for users to access and utilize the data for research, policy-making, or educational purposes. It ensures that data across different scenarios and impact categories is readily accessible for comprehensive environmental analysis.

Note:
    The class and its methods assume that the DataManager has been properly initialized and that the relevant data tables are available and correctly formatted. The users of this class should have a basic understanding of the data structure and the environmental impact scenarios to effectively utilize the retrieved data.

        Note:
            Afforestation involves converting non-forested land into forested areas. This land-use change plays a vital role in carbon sequestration,
            helping to offset carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. Additionally, afforested areas can contribute to enhancing biodiversity,
            ecosystem services, and sustainable land management practices.
