  # Emu-MPS
</div>

**Emu-mps** is a backend for the [Pulser low-level Quantum Programming toolkit](https://pulser.readthedocs.io) that lets you run Quantum Algorithms on a simulated device, using GPU acceleration if available. More in depth, emu-mps is designed to **emu**late the dynamics of programmable arrays of neutral atoms, with matrix product states (**mps**). While benchmarking is incomplete as of this writing, early results suggest that this design makes emu-mps faster and more memory-efficient than previous generations of quantum emulators at running simulations with large numbers of qubits.

As of this writing, Emu-MPS is provided for Linux and macOS but will not work under Windows.

## Installation

**Warning:** installing emu-mps will update pulser-core

### Using `hatch`, `uv` or any pyproject-compatible Python manager

To add `emu-mps` to your project, edit your `pyproject.toml` to add the line

```toml
  "emu-mps"
```

to the list of `dependencies`.


### Using `pip` or `pipx`
To install the `pipy` package using `pip` or `pipx`

1. Create a `venv` if that's not done yet

```sh
$ python -m venv venv

```

2. Enter the venv

If you're running Unix:

```sh
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

If you're running Windows:

```sh
C:\> /path/to/new/virtual/environment/Scripts/activate
```

3. Install the package

```sh
$ pip install emu-mps
# or
$ pipx install emu-mps
```

## Usage

For the time being, the easiest way to learn how to use this package is to look
at the [examples](examples/emu_mps_examples) and [notebooks](https://pasqal-io.github.io/emulators/latest/).

See also the [full documentation](https://github.com/pasqal-io/emulators/blob/main/docs/index.md) for
