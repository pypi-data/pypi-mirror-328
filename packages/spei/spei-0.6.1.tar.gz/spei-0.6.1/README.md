SPEI is a simple Python package to calculate drought indices for time series such as the SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index), SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index), and SGI (Standardized Groundwater Index). This package uses popular Python packages such as Pandas and Scipy to make it easy and versatile for the user to calculate the drought indices. Pandas Series are great for dealing with time series; providing interpolation, rolling average, and other manipulation options. SciPy enables us to use all different kinds of [distributions](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html#probability-distributions) to fit the data.

For the calculation of potential evaporation, take a look at [pyet](https://github.com/phydrus/pyet). This is another great package that uses pandas Series to calculate different kinds of potential evaporation time series.

## Available Drought Indices

| Drought Index                                | Abbreviation | Literature |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Standardized Precipitation Index             | SPI          | 1          |
| Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index | SPEI         | 2          |
| Standardized Groundwater Index               | SGI          | 3,4        |
| Standardized Streamflow Index                | SSFI         | 5          |
| Standardized Soil Moisture Index             | SSMI         | 6          |

The package is not limited to only these five drought indices. If any of the distributions in the Scipy library is valid on the observed hydrological series, the drought index can be calculated.

## Installation

Note that the method for calculating the drought indices does not come from these articles and SciPy is used for deriving the distribution. However the literature is helpful as a reference to understand the context and application of drought indices.

## Alternatives

There are other great packages available to calculate these indices. However, they are either written in R such as [SPEI](https://github.com/sbegueria/SPEI) or don't have the Standardized Groundwater Index such as [climate\_indices](https://github.com/monocongo/climate_indices). Additionaly, these packages provide ways to analyse spatial data and calculate potential evaporation. This makes these packages complex, because it is easier to only deal with time series. However, support for spatial data is something on the to-do list so help is appreciated.
