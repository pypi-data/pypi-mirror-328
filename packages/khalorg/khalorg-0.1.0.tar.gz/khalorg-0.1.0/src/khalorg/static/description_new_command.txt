Create a new khal item from an org item.

An org agenda item can be converted to a new khal agenda item by feeding the
org item through stdin to `khalorg new` and specifying the khal calendar name
as a positional argument.

The following repeats are supported: daily, weekly, monthly or yearly. The
events repeat forever, unless you specify an end date using the `--until`
option.
