# Fishweb

Fishweb is a web app manager that makes it easy to run Python ASAGI applications effortlessly.

Map domains to folders in your filesystem.

- `https://example.sofa.sh` maps to `~/fishweb/example`

Turn a new folder into a website without the need to start a development server or even setup a virtual environment.
