# Quaternions in PyTorch

Quaternions are handy mathematical tools for working with rotations and 3D transformations, and since v0.16.0 the [Kaolin Library](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin) bundles a module of low-level convenience operations with quaternions, targeting common use cases and exposing a plain PyTorch interface to all functions.

See [`kaolin.math.quat`documentation](https://kaolin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/kaolin.math.quat.html) for a full list of functions and a short python recipe in [examples/recipes/math/quaternions.py](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin/blob/master/examples/recipes/math/quaternions.py).
