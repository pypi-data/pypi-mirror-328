A Python package to estimate the sensitivity of general
continuous gravitational-wave searches.

The method should be equivalent to the semi-analytical approach derived in
[Dreissigacker, Prix, Wette (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02459) and
implemented in [Octapps](https://github.com/octapps/octapps), but here we 
implement it in Python to make it more convenient to use.

## How to install 

`cows3` is available under PyPI:

```
pip install cows3
```

as well as a Zenodo release of this software.

For the semi-analytical sensitivity estimation method you should also cite 
[Wette (2012)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5650) and
[Dreissigacker, Prix, Wette (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02459). Also,
this package makes extensive use of SWIG bindings, so please cite
[Wette (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09552) as well.
